"],["c.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Over the last decade, ‘Big Data’ has often been discussed as the new ‘most valuable’ resource in highly developed economies, driving the development of new products and services in various industries. Extracting knowledge from large data sets is increasingly seen as a strategic asset for firms, governments, and NGOs. In a similar vein, the increasing size of data sets in empirical economic research (both in number of observations and number of variables) offers new opportunities and poses new challenges for economists and business leaders. Successfully navigating the data-driven economy presupposes a certain understanding of the technologies and methods to gain insights from Big Data. This textbook introduces the reader to the basic concepts of Big Data Analytics to gain insights from large and complex data sets. Thereby, the focus of the book is on the practical application of econometrics, given large/complex data sets, and all the steps involved before actually analyzing data (data storage, data import, data preparation). The book combines conceptual/theoretical material with the practical application of the concepts with R and SQL. Thereby, the reader will acquire the basic skill set to analyze large data sets both locally and in the cloud. Various code examples and tutorials, focused on empirical economic and business research, illustrate practical techniques to handle and analyze Big Data. Throughout this book, the practical problems related to analyzing big data and the corresponding approaches to solve these problems are generally presented in the context of applied econometrics and business analytics settings. This means that I generally focus on observational data, as it is very common in economics and business/management research. Moreover, in terms of statistics/analytics techniques, this choice of context requires a particular focus on regression analysis, as this is the most frequently used statistical tool in modern applied econometrics. Finally, this choice of context defines also the scope of the examples and tutorials (both in this part and the following parts). Typically, in applied econometrics and business analytics settings, the aim of a data science project is not to deploy a machine learning model as part of an operational App or web application (as it is often the case for many working in data science). Instead, the aim of such projects is to gain insights into a particular economic/business/management question in order to facilitate data-driven decisions or the formulation of policy recommendations. Consequently, the output of such projects (and the tutorials/examples in this book) are a set of statistics summarizing the quantitative insights in a way they could be shown in a seminar/business presentation or an academic paper/business report. Finally, this choice of context will also guide the way code examples and tutorials are structured. Typically, the code examples can be considered part of an interactive session, or the writing of short analytics scripts (and not the development of larger applications). The book is organized in four main parts. The first part introduces the reader to the topic of Big Data Analytics from the perspective of a practitioner in empirical economic and business research. It covers the differences between Big P and Big N problems and shows avenues of how to practically address either. The second part focuses on the tools and platforms to work with Big Data. Initially, this part introduces a set of software tools primarily used throughout the book: (advanced) R and SQL. It then covers the conceptual basis of modern computing environments and discusses how different hardware components matter in practical local Big Data Analytics as well as how virtual servers in the cloud help to scale up and scale out analyses when the local hardware does not have enough computing resources. Building on the previous part, the third part of this book visits all: data collection and data storage, data import/ingestion, data cleaning/transformation, data aggregation, and finally, data analysis (with a particular focus on modern applied econometrics) and exploratory data visualization (with a particular focus on GIS). The chapters in this part of the book discuss basic concepts such as the split-apply-combine approach and demonstrate the practical application of these concepts when working with large data sets in R. Many tutorials and code examples illustrate how a specific task can be implemented with comparatively simple tools locally as well as with a broader set of tools in the cloud. Thereby, the reader re-visits key concepts regarding computing resources and econometric methods. The code examples, illustrations, and tutorials provided throughout the book focus on data analytics contexts in empirical economics as well as business data science/business analytics. However, the basic concepts and tools covered in the book are not domain-specific and could easily be transferred to other fields of modern data analytics/data science. "],["s.html", "Introduction", " Introduction This part of the book introduces you to the topic of analyzing big data from several perspectives. The aim of this part is to highlight the diverse aspects involved in modern econometrics when it comes to Big Data Analytics and to clarify the approach and perspective taken in this book. In a first step, we have look at what makes data big. Thereby, we make a fundamental differentiation between problems for data analysis that can arise from many observations (rows; big N) in contrast to other problems that can arise from many variables (columns; big P). In a second step, this part presents an overview over four distinct approaches to Big Data Analytics that matter most for the perspective on big data taken in this book: a) statistics/econometrics techniques specifically designed to handle big data, b) writing more efficient R code, c) using the available local computing resources more efficiently, and d) scaling up and scaling out with cloud computing resources. All of these approaches will play a role in the following parts of this book and it will be helpful to take away the most relevant conceptual basics behind these approaches from the overview presented here. Finally, this part of the book provides two extensive examples of how problems related to (too) many observations or (too) many variables can mean for practical data analysis, while highlighting how some of the four approaches (a-d) matter in resolving these problems. "],["what-is-big-in-big-data.html", "Chapter 1 What is big in “Big Data”?", " Chapter 1 What is big in “Big Data”? In this book, we will think of Big Data as data that is (a) difficult to handle and (b) hard to get value from due to its size and complexity. The handling of Big Data is difficult as the data is often gathered from unorthodox sources, providing poorly structured data (e.g., raw text, web pages, images, etc.) as well as because of the infrastructure needed to store and load/process large amounts of data. Then, the issue of statistical computation itself is becoming a challenge. Taken together, getting value/insights from Big Data is related to three distinct properties that render its analysis difficult: Handling the complexity and variety of sources, structures, and formats of data for analytics purposes is becoming generally increasingly challenging in the context of empirical economic research and business analytics. On the one hand the ongoing digitization of information and processes boosts the generation and storage of digital data on all kinds of economic and social activity, making such data basically more available for analysis. On the other hand, however, the first order focus of such digitization is typically an end user who directly interacts with the information, is part of these processes, and not the data scientist or data analyst who might be interested in analyzing such data later on. Therefore the interface to systematically collect such data for analytics purposes is not optimal. Moreover, data might come in semi-structured formats such as JSON or HTML, raw text, or even images. Each of which needs a different approach for importing/loading and pre-processing. Anybody who has worked on data analytics projects that build on various types of raw data from various sources knows that a large part of the practical data work deals with how to handle the complexity and variety in order to get to a useful analytic dataset. The big P problem: a data set has close to or even more variables than observations, which renders the search for a good predictive model with traditional econometric techniques difficult or illusive. For example, suppose you run an e-commerce business that sells hundreds of thousands of products to tens of thousands of customers. You want to figure out from which product category a customer is most likely to buy an item from, based on her previous product page visits. That is, you want to (in simple terms) regress an indicator of purchasing from a specific category on indicators for previous product page visits. Given this set up, you would potentially end up with hundreds of thousands of explanatory indicator variables (and potentially even linear combinations of those), while you “only” have tens of thousands of observations (one per user/customer) to estimate your model. These sorts of problems are at the core of the domain of modern predictive econometrics, which shows how machine learning approaches like the LASSO can be applied in order to get reasonable estimates of such a predictive model. The big N problem: a data set has massive amounts of observations (rows) such that it cannot be handled with standard data analytics techniques and/or on a standard desktop computer. For example, suppose you want to segment your e-commerce customers based on the traces they leave on your website’s server. Specifically, you plan to use the server log files (when does a customer visit the site from where, etc.) in combination with purchase records as well as written product reviews by the users. You focus on 50 variables that you measure on a daily basis over five years for all users. The resulting data set has \\(50,000 \\times 365 \\times 5=91,250,000\\) rows and with 50 variables (50 columns) over 4.5 billion cells. Such a data set can easily take up dozens of Gigabytes on the hard disk. Hence it will either not fit into the memory of a standard computer to begin with (import fails), or the standard programs to process and analyze the data will likely be very inefficient and take ages to finish when used on such a large data set. There are both econometric techniques as well as various specialized software and hardware tools to handle such a situation. After having a close look at the practical data analytics challenges behind either big P and big N in Chapter 3, most of this book focuses on practical challenges and solutions related to big N problems. However, several of the chapters contain code examples that are primarily discussed as a solution to a big N problem, but are shown in the context of econometric/machine learning techniques that are broadly used, for example, to find good predictive models (based on many variables, i.e., big P). At the same time, many of the topics discussed in this book are in one way or the other related to the difficulties of handling various types of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Hence you will get familiar with practical techniques to deal with complexity and variety of data on the side. "],["approaches-to-analyzing-big-data.html", "Chapter 2 Approaches to analyzing Big Data", " Chapter 2 Approaches to analyzing Big Data Lost in the hoopla about such [Hadoop MapReduce] skills is the embarrassing fact that once upon a time, one could do such computing tasks, and even much more ambitious ones, much more easily than in this fancy new setting! A dataset could fit on a single processor, and the global maximum of the array “x” could be computed with the six-character code fragment “max(x)” in, say, Matlab or R. (Donoho 2017) Why do you use a sample of ten million? Uhm, I mean… appart from the fact that you can? Overheard by the author at the Applied Statistics Seminar at IQSS, Harvard University in Winter 2016. Throughout the book, we consider four approaches on how to solve challenges related to analyzing big N and big P data. Those approaches should not be understood as mutually exclusive categories, rather they should help us to look at a specific problem from different angles in order to find the most efficient tool/approach to proceed. @refFour approaches to/perspectives on solving big N problems in data analytics. presents an illustrative overview over the four approaches. Figure 2.1: Software, local computing resources, and cloud resources. Statistics/econometrics and machine learning: During the initial hype surrounding Big Data/Data Science about a decade ago, statisticians prominently (and justifiably) pointed out that statistics has always been a very useful tool when analyzing “all the data” (the entire population) is too costly.1 In simple terms, when confronted with the challenge of answering an empirical question based on a big N data set (which is too large to process on a normal computer), one might ask “why not simply take a random sample”? In some situations this might actually be a very reasonable question, and we should be sure to have a good answer for it before we rent a cluster computer with specialized software for distributed computing. After all, statistical inference is there to help us answer empirical questions in situations where collecting data on the entire population would be practically impossible or simply way too costly. In today’s world, digital data is abundant in many domains and the collection is not so much the problem anymore but our standard data analytics tools are not made to analyze such amounts of data. Depending on the question and data at hand, it might thus make sense to simply use well-established “traditional” statistics/econometrics in order to properly address the empirical question. Note, though, that there are also various situations in which this would not work well. For example, consider online advertising. If you want to figure out which user characteristics make a user significantly more likely to click on a specific type of ad, you likely need hundreds of millions of data points because the expected probability that a specific user clicks on an ad is likely generally very low. That is, in many practical big data analytics settings you might expect rather small effects. Consequently, you need to rely on a big-N data set in order to get the statistical power to distinguish an actual effect from a zero effect. However, even then, it might make sense to first look at newer statistical procedures that are specifically made for big-N data before renting a cluster computer. Similarly, traditional statistical/econometric approaches might help to deal with big-p data, but they are usually rather inefficient or have rather problematic statistical properties in such a situation. However, there are also well-established machine learning approaches to better address these problems. In sum, before focusing on specialized software like Hadoop or Spark and scaling up hardware resources, make sure to use the adequate statistical tools for a big-data situation. This can save a lot of time and money. Once you have found the most efficient statistical procedure for the problem at hand, you can focus on how to compute it. Writing efficient code: no matter how suitable a statistical procedure theoretically is to analyze a large data set, there are always various ways of how this procedure can be implemented in software. Some ways will be less efficient than others. When working with small or moderately sized data sets you might not even notice whether your data analytics script is written in an efficient way. However, it might get uncomfortable to run your script once you confront it with a large data set. Hence the question you should ask yourself when taking this perspective is, “can I write this script in a different way to make it faster (but achieve the same result)?” Before introducing you to specialized R-packages to work with large data sets, we thus look at a few important aspects of how to write efficient/fast code in R. Use limited local computing resources more efficiently: there are several strategies to use the available local computing resources (your PC) more efficiently, and many of those have been around for a while. In simple terms, these strategies are based on the idea of more explicitly telling the computer how to allocate and use the available hardware resources as part of a data analytics task (something that is usually automatically taken care of by the PC’s operating system). We will touch upon several of these strategies, such as multi-core processing and the efficient use of virtual memory and then practically implement these strategies with the help of specialized R packages. Unlike writing more efficient R code, these packages/strategies usually come with an overhead. That is, they help you save time only after a certain threshold. In other words, not using these approaches can be faster if the data set is not “too big”. In addition, there can be trade-offs between using one vs the other hardware component more efficiently. Hence, using these strategies can be tricky and the best approach might well depend on the specific situation. The aim is thus to make you comfortable with answering the question “how can I use my local computing environment more efficiently to further speed up this specific analytics task”? Scale up and scale out: once you have properly considered all of the above, but the task still cannot be done in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to either scale up or scale out the available computing resources. Scaling up refers to enlarging your machine (e.g., add more random access memory) or to switching to a more powerful machine altogether. Technically, this can mean literally building an additional hardware-device into your PC, today it usually means renting a virtual server in the cloud. Instead of using a “bigger machine”, scaling out means using several machines in concert (cluster computer, distributed systems). While this also has often been done locally (connecting several PCs to a cluster of PCs in order to combine all their computing power), today this too is usually done in the cloud (due to the much easier set up and maintenance). Practically, a key difference between scaling out and scaling up is that by-and-large scaling up does not require you to get familiar with specialized software. You can simply run the exact same script you tested locally on a larger machine in the cloud. Although most of the tools and services available to scale out your analyses are by now quite easy to use, you will have to get familiar with some additional software components and programming paradigms to really make use of the latter.2 In addition, in some situations, scaling up might be perfectly sufficient while in others only scaling out makes sense (particularly if you need massive amounts of memory). In any event, you should be comfortable dealing with the question “does it make sense to scale up or scale out?” and “if yes, how can it be done?” in a given situation.3 Whether one or the other approach is “better” is sometimes a topic hotly debated between academics and/or practitioners with different academic backgrounds. The point of the following chapters is not to argue for one or the other approach, but to make you familiar with these different perspectives in order to make you more comfortable and able to take on large amounts of data for your analytics project. When might be one or the other approach/perspective be more useful? This is highly context-dependent. However, as a general rule of thumb, consider the order of how the different approaches have been presented above: - First, ask yourself whether there isn’t an absolutely trivial solution to your big N problem, such as taking a random sample. I know, this sound banal, and you would be surprised how many books and lectures focusing on the data engineering side of Big N do not even mention this. But, we should not forget that the entire apparatus of statistical inference is essentially based on this idea.4 There is, however, a well-justifiable excuse to not simply take a random sample of a large dataset. Both in academic research as well as in business data science and business analytics, the decision to be facilitated with data might in any event only have measurable consequences in rather a few cases. That is, the effect size of deciding either for A or B is anyway expected to be small, and hence we need sufficient statistical power (large N) to take a meaningful decision. Second, once you know on which final sample/dataset which statistical procedure should be run, be aware of how to write your analytics scripts in a most efficient way. As you will see in Chapter 4, there are a handful of R’s idiosyncrasies that are worth the while to keep in mind in this regard. This will make interactive sessions in the early, exploratory phase of a big data project much more comfortable. Third, once you have a clearer idea of the bottle necks in the data preparation and analytics scripts, aim to optimize the usage of the available local computing resources. In almost any organizational structure, be it at a university department, a small firm, or a multinational conglomerate, switching from your laptop or desktop computer to a larger computing infrastructure, either locally or in the cloud, means additional administrative and budgetary hurdles (which means money and time spent on something other than interpreting data analysis results). That is, even before setting up the infrastructure and transferring your script and data, you will have to make an effort for to scale up or scale out. Therefore, as a general rule of thumb, this option should be considered as a measure of last resort in this book. Following this recommended order of consideration, before we focus extensively on the topics of using local computing resources more efficiently and scaling up/out (in parts II and III of this book), we need to establish some of the basics regarding what is meant by statistical/econometric solutions for big P and big N problems (in the next chapter), as well as introduce a couple of helpful programming tools and skills when working on computationally intense tasks (in Chapter 4). References "],["two-domains-of-big-data-analytics.html", "Chapter 3 Two domains of Big Data Analytics 3.1 A practical big P problem 3.2 A practical big N problem 3.3 Conclusion", " Chapter 3 Two domains of Big Data Analytics As discussed in the previous chapter, data analytics in the context of Big Data can be broadly be categorized into two domains of statistical challenges: techniques/estimators to address big P problems and techniques/estimators to address big N problems. While this book predominantly focuses on how to handle Big Data for applied economics and business analytics settings in the context of big N problems, it is useful to set the stage for the following chapters with two practical examples concerning big P and big N methods. 3.1 A practical big P problem Due to the abundance of digital data on all kinds of human activities, both empirical economists and business analysts are increasingly confronted with high-dimensional data (many signals, many variables). While having a lot of variables to work with sounds kind of like a good thing, it introduces new problems in coming up with useful predictive models. In the extreme case of having more variables in the model than observations, traditional methods cannot be used at all. In the less extreme case of just having dozens or hundreds of variables in a model (and plenty of observations), we risk “falsely” discovering seemingly influential variables and consequently coming up with a model with potentially very misleading out-of-sample predictions. So how can we find a reasonable model?5 Let us look at a real-life example. Suppose you work for Google’s e-commerce platform www.googlemerchandiseshop.com, and you are in charge of predicting purchases (i.e., a user is actually buying something from your store in a given session) based on user and browser-session characteristics.6 The dependent variable purchase is an indicator equal to 1 if the corresponding shop visit leads to a purchase and equal to 0 otherwise. All other variables contain information about the user and the session (Where is the user located? Which browser is (s)he using? etc.). As the dependent variable is binary, we will first estimate a simple logit model, in which we use the origins of the store visitors (how did a visitor end up in the shop) as explanatory variables. Note that many of these variables are categorical, and the model matrix thus contains a lot of ‘’dummies’’ (indicator variables). The plan in this (intentionally naive) first approach is to simply add a lot of explanatory variables to the model, run logit, and then select the variables with statistically significant coefficient estimates as the final predictive model. The following code snippet covers the import of the data, the creation of the model matrix (with all the dummy-variables), as well as the logit estimation. # import/inspect data ga &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/ga.csv&quot;) head(ga[, c(&quot;source&quot;, &quot;browser&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;purchase&quot;)]) ## source browser city purchase ## 1 google Chrome San Jose 1 ## 2 (direct) Edge Charlotte 1 ## 3 (direct) Safari San Francisco 1 ## 4 (direct) Safari Los Angeles 1 ## 5 (direct) Chrome Chicago 1 ## 6 (direct) Chrome Sunnyvale 1 # create model matrix (dummy vars) mm &lt;- cbind(ga$purchase, model.matrix(purchase~source, data=ga,)[,-1]) mm_df &lt;- as.data.frame(mm) # clean variable names names(mm_df) &lt;- c(&quot;purchase&quot;, gsub(&quot;source&quot;, &quot;&quot;, names(mm_df)[-1])) # run logit model1 &lt;- glm(purchase ~ ., data=mm_df, family=binomial) Now we can perform the t-tests and filter out the “relevant” variables. model1_sum &lt;- summary(model1) # select &quot;significant&quot; variables for final model pvalues &lt;- model1_sum$coefficients[,&quot;Pr(&gt;|z|)&quot;] vars &lt;- names(pvalues[which(pvalues&lt;0.05)][-1]) vars ## [1] &quot;bing&quot; ## [2] &quot;dfa&quot; ## [3] &quot;docs.google.com&quot; ## [4] &quot;facebook.com&quot; ## [5] &quot;google&quot; ## [6] &quot;google.com&quot; ## [7] &quot;m.facebook.com&quot; ## [8] &quot;Partners&quot; ## [9] &quot;quora.com&quot; ## [10] &quot;siliconvalley.about.com&quot; ## [11] &quot;sites.google.com&quot; ## [12] &quot;t.co&quot; ## [13] &quot;youtube.com&quot; Finally, we re-estimate our “final” model # specify and estimate the final model finalmodel &lt;- glm(purchase ~., data = mm_df[, c(&quot;purchase&quot;, vars)], family = binomial) The first problem with this approach is that we should not trust the coefficient t-tests based on which we have selected the covariates too much. The first model contains 62 explanatory variables (plus the intercept). With that many hypothesis tests, we quite likely reject the NULL of no predictive effect although there is actually no predictive effect. In addition, this approach turns out to be unstable. There might be correlation between some variables in the original set of variables, and adding/removing even one variable might substantially affect the predictive power of the model (and the apparent relevance of other variables). We see this already from the summary of our final model estimate (generated in the next code chunk). One of the apparently relevant predictors (dfa) is not at all significant anymore in this specification. Thus, we might be tempted to further change the model, which in turn would again change the apparent relevance of other covariates, and so on. summary(finalmodel)$coef[,c(&quot;Estimate&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;|z|)&quot;)] ## Estimate Pr(&gt;|z|) ## (Intercept) -1.3831 0.000e+00 ## bing -1.4647 4.416e-03 ## dfa -0.1865 1.271e-01 ## docs.google.com -2.0181 4.714e-02 ## facebook.com -1.1663 3.873e-04 ## google -1.0149 6.321e-168 ## google.com -2.9607 3.193e-05 ## m.facebook.com -3.6920 2.331e-04 ## Partners -4.3747 3.942e-14 ## quora.com -3.1277 1.869e-03 ## siliconvalley.about.com -2.2456 1.242e-04 ## sites.google.com -0.5968 1.356e-03 ## t.co -2.0509 4.316e-03 ## youtube.com -6.9935 4.197e-23 An alternative approach would be to estimate models based on all possible combinations of covariates and then use that sequence of models to select the final model based on some out-of-sample prediction performance measure. Clearly such an approach would take a long time to compute. Instead, the lasso estimator provides a convenient and efficient way to get a sequence of candidate models. The key idea behind the lasso is to penalize model complexity (the cause of instability) during the estimation procedure.7 In a second step, we can then select a final model from the sequence of candidate models based on, for example, “out-of-sample” prediction in a k-fold cross validation. The gamlr package provides both parts of this procedure (lasso for the sequence of candidate models, and selection of the “best” model based on k-fold cross-validation). # load packages library(gamlr) # create the model matrix mm &lt;- model.matrix(purchase~source, data = ga) In cases with both many observations and many candidate explanatory variables, the model matrix might get very large. Even simply generating the model matrix might be a computational burden, as we might run out of memory to hold the model matrix object. If this large model matrix is sparse (i.e, has a lot of 0 entries), there is a much more memory efficient way to store it in an R object. R provides ways to represent such sparse matrices in a compressed way in specialized R objects (such as CsparseMatrix provided in the Matrix package). Instead of containing all \\(n\\times m\\) cells of the matrix, these objects only explicitly store the cells with non-zero values and the corresponding index. Below, we make use of the high-level sparse.model.matrix function to generate the model matrix and store it in a sparse matrix object. To illustrate the point of a more memory-efficient representation, we show that the traditional matrix object is about 7.5 times larger than the sparse version. # create the sparse model matrix mm_sparse &lt;- sparse.model.matrix(purchase~source, data = ga) # the sparse representation needs less than 15% of # the memory needed for the standard matrix representation: as.numeric(object.size(mm)/object.size(mm_sparse)) ## [1] 7.525 Finally, we run the lasso estimation with k-fold cross-validation. # run k-fold cross-validation lasso cvpurchase &lt;- cv.gamlr(mm_sparse, ga$purchase, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) We then can illustrate the performance of the selected final model, for example, with an ROC curve. Note that both the coef method and the predict method for gamlr objects automatically select the ‘best’ model. # load packages library(PRROC) # use &quot;best&quot; model for prediction # (model selection based on average OSS deviance, here CV1se rule pred &lt;- predict(cvpurchase$gamlr, mm_sparse, type=&quot;response&quot;) # compute tpr, fpr, plot ROC comparison &lt;- roc.curve(scores.class0 = pred, weights.class0=ga$purchase, curve=TRUE) plot(comparison) Hence, econometrics techniques such as the lasso help deal with big P problems by providing reasonable ways to select a good predictive model (in other words, decide which of the many variables should be included). 3.2 A practical big N problem Big N problems are situations in which we know what type of model we want to use but the number of observations is too big to run the estimation (the computer crashes or slows down significantly). The simplest statistical solution to such a problem is usually to just estimate the model based on a smaller sample. However, we might not want to do that for other reasons (see introduction above). As an illustration of how an alternative statistical procedure can speed up the analysis of big N datasets, we look at a procedure to estimate linear models when the classical OLS estimator is computationally too demanding when analyzing large datasets: The Uluru algorithm (Dhillon et al. 2013). 3.2.1 OLS as a point of reference Recall the OLS estimator in matrix notation, given the linear model \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}\\beta + \\epsilon\\): \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{y}\\). In order to compute \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}\\), we have to compute \\((\\mathbf{X}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\), which implies a computationally expensive matrix inversion.8 If our dataset is large, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is large and the inversion can take up a lot of computation time. Moreover, the inversion and matrix multiplication to get \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}\\) needs a lot of memory. In practice, it might well be that the estimation of a linear model via OLS with the standard approach in R (lm()) brings a computer to its knees, as there is not enough RAM available. To further illustrate the point, we implement the OLS estimator in R. beta_ols &lt;- function(X, y) { # compute cross products and inverse XXi &lt;- solve(crossprod(X,X)) Xy &lt;- crossprod(X, y) return( XXi %*% Xy ) } Now, we will test our OLS estimator function with a few (pseudo-)random numbers in a Monte Carlo study. First, we set the sample size parameters n (the number of observations in our pseudo-sample) and p (the number of variables describing each of these observations) and initiate the dataset X. # set parameter values n &lt;- 10000000 p &lt;- 4 # generate sample based on Monte Carlo # generate a design matrix (~ our &#39;dataset&#39;) # with 4 variables and 10,000 observations X &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n*p, mean = 10), ncol = p) # add column for intercept X &lt;- cbind(rep(1, n), X) Now we define what the real linear model that we have in mind looks like and compute the output y of this model, given the input X.9 # MC model y &lt;- 2 + 1.5*X[,2] + 4*X[,3] - 3.5*X[,4] + 0.5*X[,5] + rnorm(n) Finally, we test our beta_ols function. # apply the OLS estimator beta_ols(X, y) ## [,1] ## [1,] 2.0095 ## [2,] 1.4992 ## [3,] 3.9996 ## [4,] -3.5000 ## [5,] 0.5002 3.2.2 The Uluru algorithm as an alternative to OLS Following Dhillon et al. (2013), we implement a procedure to compute \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{Uluru}\\): \\[\\hat{\\beta}_{Uluru}=\\hat{\\beta}_{FS} + \\hat{\\beta}_{correct}\\], where \\[\\hat{\\beta}_{FS} = (\\mathbf{X}_{subs}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X}_{subs})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{subs}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{y}_{subs}\\], and \\[\\hat{\\beta}_{correct}= \\frac{n_{subs}}{n_{rem}} \\cdot (\\mathbf{X}_{subs}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X}_{subs})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_{rem}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{R}_{rem}\\], and \\[\\mathbf{R}_{rem} = \\mathbf{Y}_{rem} - \\mathbf{X}_{rem} \\cdot \\hat{\\beta}_{FS}\\]. The key idea behind this is that the computational bottleneck of the OLS estimator, the cross product and matrix inversion,\\((\\mathbf{X}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\), is only computed on a sub-sample (\\(X_{subs}\\), etc.), not the entire dataset. However, the remainder of the dataset is also taken into consideration (in order to correct a bias arising from the sub-sampling). Again, we implement the estimator in R to further illustrate this point. beta_uluru &lt;- function(X_subs, y_subs, X_rem, y_rem) { # compute beta_fs #(this is simply OLS applied to the subsample) XXi_subs &lt;- solve(crossprod(X_subs, X_subs)) Xy_subs &lt;- crossprod(X_subs, y_subs) b_fs &lt;- XXi_subs %*% Xy_subs # compute \\mathbf{R}_{rem} R_rem &lt;- y_rem - X_rem %*% b_fs # compute \\hat{\\beta}_{correct} b_correct &lt;- (nrow(X_subs)/(nrow(X_rem))) * XXi_subs %*% crossprod(X_rem, R_rem) # beta uluru return(b_fs + b_correct) } We then test it with the same input as above: # set size of sub-sample n_subs &lt;- 1000 # select sub-sample and remainder n_obs &lt;- nrow(X) X_subs &lt;- X[1L:n_subs,] y_subs &lt;- y[1L:n_subs] X_rem &lt;- X[(n_subs+1L):n_obs,] y_rem &lt;- y[(n_subs+1L):n_obs] # apply the uluru estimator beta_uluru(X_subs, y_subs, X_rem, y_rem) ## [,1] ## [1,] 2.0277 ## [2,] 1.4997 ## [3,] 3.9971 ## [4,] -3.4998 ## [5,] 0.5003 This looks quite good already. Let’s have a closer look with a little Monte Carlo study. The aim of the simulation study is to visualize the difference between the classical OLS approach and the Uluru algorithm with regard to bias and time complexity if we increase the sub-sample size in Uluru. For simplicity, we only look at the first estimated coefficient \\(\\beta_{1}\\). # define sub-samples n_subs_sizes &lt;- seq(from = 1000, to = 500000, by=10000) n_runs &lt;- length(n_subs_sizes) # compute uluru result, stop time mc_results &lt;- rep(NA, n_runs) mc_times &lt;- rep(NA, n_runs) for (i in 1:n_runs) { # set size of sub-sample n_subs &lt;- n_subs_sizes[i] # select sub-sample and remainder n_obs &lt;- nrow(X) X_subs &lt;- X[1L:n_subs,] y_subs &lt;- y[1L:n_subs] X_rem &lt;- X[(n_subs+1L):n_obs,] y_rem &lt;- y[(n_subs+1L):n_obs] mc_results[i] &lt;- beta_uluru(X_subs, y_subs, X_rem, y_rem)[2] # (1 is the intercept) mc_times[i] &lt;- system.time(beta_uluru(X_subs, y_subs, X_rem, y_rem))[3] } # compute OLS results and OLS time ols_time &lt;- system.time(beta_ols(X, y)) ols_res &lt;- beta_ols(X, y)[2] Let’s visualize the comparison with OLS. # load packages library(ggplot2) # prepare data to plot plotdata &lt;- data.frame(beta1 = mc_results, time_elapsed = mc_times, subs_size = n_subs_sizes) First, let’s look at the time used estimate the linear model. ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = subs_size, y = time_elapsed)) + geom_point(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = ols_time[3], color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 1) + theme_minimal() + ylab(&quot;Time elapsed&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Subsample size&quot;) The horizontal red line indicates the computation time for estimation via OLS; the green points indicate the computation time for the estimation via the Ulruru algorithm. Note that even for large sub-samples, the computation time is substantially lower than for OLS. Finally, let’s have a look at how close the results are to OLS. ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = subs_size, y = beta1)) + geom_hline(yintercept = ols_res, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 1) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1.5, color = &quot;green&quot;, size = 1) + geom_point(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + theme_minimal() + ylab(&quot;Estimated coefficient&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Subsample size&quot;) The horizontal red line indicates the size of the estimated coefficient, when using OLS. The horizontal green line indicates the size of the actual coefficient. The green points indicate the size of the same coefficient estimated by the Uluru algorithm for different sub-sample sizes. Note that even relatively small sub-samples already deliver estimates very close to the OLS estimates. Taken together, the example illustrates that alternative statistical methods, optimized for large amounts of data, can deliver results very close to traditional approaches. Yet, they can deliver these results much more efficiently. 3.3 Conclusion When applying econometrics to ‘’large’’ datasets, two types of problems dominate: a) the number of covariates is ‘too large’ to handle with traditional estimators (big P problem) and/or b) the number of observations is ‘too large’ to handle with traditional estimators (big N problem). The first problem is being addressed by an interesting new strain of econometrics literature, which builds on previously known machine learning algorithms such as lasso and random forest and clarifies the statistical properties of predictions coming from these algorithms. While the following chapters will repeatedly link to these contributions in specific code examples, the main focus of the following chapters lies on the big N problem and the key underlying concepts (in terms of software, hardware, and faster new estimators) to productively perform data analytics tasks when confronted with large amounts of data. Several of the following chapters will also focus on something that is often ignored in the applied econometrics literature: how do we get from the raw data to the cleaned and filtered analytic dataset to run regressions. While these topics are generally highly relevant for proper data science and data analytics workflows, you will see that these topics are absolutely crucial when working with large datasets. References "],["p.html", "Introduction", " Introduction At the center of Figure @refSoftware, local computing resources, and cloud resources. you see an illustration of the key components of a standard local computing environment to process digital data. In this book, these components typically serve the purpose of computing a statistic, given a large dataset as input. In this part of the book, you will get familiar with how each of these components plays a role in the context of big data analytics and how you recognize and resolve potential problems caused by large datasets/large working loads for either of these components. The three most relevant of these components are: Mass storage. This is the type of computer memory we use to store data in the long run. The mass storage device in our local computing environment (e.g., our laptop) is generally referred to as the hard drive or hard disk. RAM. In order to work with data (e.g., in R), it first has to be loaded into the memory of our computer. More specifically, into the random access memory (RAM). Typically, data is only loaded in the RAM for as long as we are working with it. CPU. The component actually processing data is the central processing unit (CPU). When using R to process data, R commands are translated into complex combinations of a small sets of basic operations, which the CPU then executes. For the rest of this book, consider the main difference between common ‘data analytics’ and ‘big data analytics’ to be the following: in a big data analytics context, the standard usage of one or several of the standard hardware components in your local computer fails to work or works very inefficiently because the amount of data overwhelms its normal capacity. Figure 3.1: Software, local computing resources, and cloud resources. However, before we discuss these hardware issues in Chapter 6, Chapter 5 focuses on the software we will work with in order to make use of these hardware components in a most efficient way. This perspective is symbolized in the left part of Figure ??. There will be three main software components with which we work in what follows. The first is the terminal (i.e., bash): instead of using graphical user interfaces to interact with our local computing environment, we will rather use the terminal to install software, download files, inspect files, and inspect hardware performance. For those of you not yet used to working with the terminal, do not worry! There are no prerequisites in knowledge about working with the terminal and most of the use cases in this book are very simple and well explained. At this point, just note that here will be two types of code chunks (code examples) shown in what follows: either they show code which should be run in the terminal (in RStudio, such code should thus be entered in the tab/window called Terminal), and R code (in RStudio, this code should be entered in the Tab/window called Console). R will be the main language used throughout this book. It will be the primary language to gather, import, clean, visualize, and analyze data. However, as you will already see in some of the examples in this part of the book, we will often not necessarily use base R, but rather use R as a high-level interface to more specialized software and services. On the one hand this means we will install and use several specialized R packages implemented for the work with large datasets that are in fact written in other (faster) languages such as C. On the other hand, this will mean that we use R commands to communicate with other lower-level software systems that are particularly made to handle large amounts of data (such as data warehouses, or software to run analytics scripts on cluster computers). The point is that even if the final computation is not actually done in R, all you need to know to get the particular job done are the corresponding R commands to trigger this final computation. There is one more indispensable software tool on which we will build throughout the book: the Structured Query Language (SQL), or to be precise, different variants of SQL in different contexts. The main reason for this is twofold: first, even if you primarily interact with some of the lower-level big data software tools from within R, it is often more comfortable (or, in some cases, even necessary) to send some of the instructions in the form of SQL commands (wrapped in an R function); second, while many of you might have only heard of SQL in the context of traditional relational database systems, SQL-variants are nowadays actually used to interact with a variety of the most important big data systems, ranging from Apache Spark (a unified analytics platform for large-scale data processing) to Apache Druid (a column-based distributed data store) and AWS Athena (a cloud-based, serverless query service for simple storage/data lakes). Hence, if you work in data analytics/data science and want to seriously engage with big data, knowing your ways around SQL is a very important asset. Finally, Chapters 7 and 8 consider the situation where all of the tweaks to use the local computing resources most efficiently are not enough to get the job done (one or several components are still overwhelmed and/or it takes simply too much time to run the analysis). From the hardware perspective, there are two basic strategies to cope with such a situation: Scale out (‘vertical scaling’): Distribute the workload over several computers (or separate components of a system). Scale up (‘horizontal scaling’): Extend the physical capacity of the affected component by building a system with a large amount of RAM shared between applications. This sounds like a trivial solution (‘if RAM is too small, buy more RAM…’), but in practice it can be very expensive. Nowadays, either of these approaches is typically taken with the help of cloud resources (illustrated in the right part of Figure ??). How this is basically done is introduced in Chapter 8. Regarding horizontal scaling, you will see that the transition from a local computing environment to the cloud (involving some or all of the core computing components) is rather straightforward to learn. However, vertical scaling for really massive datasets involves some new hardware and software concepts related to what is generally called distributed systems. To this end, we first introduce the most relevant concepts related to distributed systems in Chapter 7. "],["software-programming-with-big-data.html", "Chapter 4 Software: Programming with (Big) Data 4.1 Domains of programming with (big) data 4.2 Measuring R performance 4.3 Writing efficient R code 4.4 SQL basics 4.5 Wrapping up", " Chapter 4 Software: Programming with (Big) Data The programming language and computing environment R is particularly made for writing code in a data analytics context. However, the language was developed at a time when data analytics was primarily focused on moderately sized data sets that can easily be loaded/imported and worked with on a common PC. Depending on the field or industry you work in, this is not anymore the case today. In this chapter, we will explore some of R’s (potential) weaknesses as well as learn how to avoid them and how to exploit some of R’s strengths when it comes to working with large data sets. The first part of this chapter is primarily focused on understanding code profiling and improving code with the aim of making computationally intense data analytics scripts in R run faster. This chapter presupposes basic knowledge of R data structures and data types as well as experience with basic programming concepts such as loops.10 While R is a very useful tool for many aspects of big data analytics that we will cover in the following chapters, R alone is not enough for a basic big data analytics toolbox. The second part of this chapter introduces the reader to the Structured Query Language (SQL), a programming language designed for managing data in relational databases. Although the type of databases where SQL is traditionally encountered would not necessarily be considered part of big data analytics today, some versions of SQL are now used with systems particularly designed for big data analytics (such as Amazon Athena and Google BigQuery). Hence, with a good knowledge of R in combination with basic SQL skills, you will be able to productively engage with a large array of practical big data analytics problems. 4.1 Domains of programming with (big) data Programming tasks in the context of data analytics typically fall into one of the following broad categories. Procedures to import/export data. Procedures to clean and filter data. Implement functions for statistical analysis. When writing a program to process large amounts of data in any of these areas, it is helpful to take into consideration the following design choices: Which basic (already implemented) R functions are more or less suitable as building blocks for the program?11 How can we exploit/avoid some of R’s lower-level characteristics in order to write more efficient code? Is there a need to interface with a lower-level programming language in order to speed up the code? (advanced topic) Finally, there is an additional important point to be made regarding the writing of code for statistical analysis: Independent of how we write a statistical procedure in R (or in any other language, for that matter), keep in mind that there might be an alternative statistical procedure/algorithm that is faster but delivers approximately the same result (as long as we use a sufficiently large sample). 4.2 Measuring R performance When writing a data analysis script in R to process large amounts of data, it generally makes sense to first test each crucial part of the script with a small sub-sample. In order to nevertheless quickly recognize potential bottle necks, there are a couple of R packages that help you keep track of how long exactly each component of your script needs to process as well as how much memory it uses. The table below lists some of the packages and functions that you should keep in mind when “profiling” and testing your code. package function purpose utils object.size() Provides an estimate of the memory that is being used to store an R object. pryr object_size() Works similarly to object.size(), but counts more accurately and includes the size of environments. pryr mem_used() Returns the total amount of memory (in megabytes) currently used by R. pryr mem_change() Shows the change in memory (in megabytes) before and after running code. base system.time() Returns CPU (and other) times that an R expression used. microbenchmark microbenchmark() Highly accurate timing of R expression evaluation. bench mark() Benchmark a series of functions. profvis profvis() Profiles an R expression and visualizes the profiling data (usage of memory, time elapsed, etc.). Most of these functions are used in an interactive way in the R console. They serve either of two purposes that are central to profiling and improving your code’s performance. First, in order to assess the performance of your R code you probably want to know how long it takes to run your entire script or a specific part of your script. The system.time()-function provides an easy way to check this. This function is loaded by default with R, there is no need to install an additional package. Simply wrap it around the line(s) of code that you want to assess. # how much time does it take to run this loop? system.time(for (i in 1:100) {i + 5}) ## user system elapsed ## 0.001 0.001 0.002 Note that each time you run this line of code, the returned amount of time varies slightly. This has to do with the fact that the actual time needed to run a line of code can depend on various other processes happening at the same time on your computer. The microbenchmark and bench packages provide additional functions to measure execution time in more sophisticated ways. In particular, they account for the fact that the processing time for the same code might vary and automatically run the code several times in order to return statistics about the processing time. In addition, microbenchmark() provides highly detailed and highly accurate timing of R expression evaluation. The function is particularly useful to accurately find even “minor” room for improvement when testing a data analysis script on a smaller sub-sample (which might scale when working on a large data set). For example, suppose you need to run a for-loop over millions of iterations and there are different ways to implement the loop of the body (which does not take too much time to process in one iteration). Note that the function actually evaluates the R expression in question many times and returns a statistical summary of the timings. # load package library(microbenchmark) # how much time does it take to run this loop (exactly)? microbenchmark(for (i in 1:100) {i + 5}) ## Unit: milliseconds ## expr min lq mean ## for (i in 1:100) { i + 5 } 1.092 1.137 1.203 ## median uq max neval ## 1.157 1.187 4.625 100 Second, a key aspect to improving the performance of data analysis scripts in R is to detect inefficient memory allocation as well as avoiding that an R-object is either growing too much or is generally too large to handle in memory. To this end, you might want to monitor how much memory R occupies at different points in your script as well as how much memory is taken up by individual R objects. For example, object.size() returns the size of an R object, that is the amount of memory it takes up in the R environment in bytes (pryr::object_size() counts slightly more accurately). hello &lt;- &quot;Hello, World!&quot; object.size(hello) ## 120 bytes This is useful to implementing your script with a generally less memory-intense approach. For example, for a specific task it might not matter whether a particular variable is stored as a character vector or a factor. But storing it as character turns out to be more memory intense (why?). # initiate a large string vector containing letters large_string &lt;- rep(LETTERS[1:20], 1000^2) head(large_string) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; # store the same information as a factor in a new variable large_factor &lt;- as.factor(large_string) # is one bigger than the other? object.size(large_string) - object.size(large_factor) ## 79999456 bytes pryr::mem_change() is useful to track how different parts of your script affect the overall memory occupied by R. # load package library(pryr) # initiate a vector with 1000 (pseudo)-random numbers mem_change( thousand_numbers &lt;- runif(1000) ) ## 9.64 kB # initiate a vector with 1M (pseudo)-random numbers mem_change( a_million_numbers &lt;- runif(1000^2) ) ## 8 MB bench::mark() allows you to easily compare the performance of several different implementations of a code chunk both regarding timing and memory usage. The following code example illustrates this in a comparison of two approaches to computing the product of each element in a vector x with a factor z. # load packages library(bench) # initiate variables x &lt;- 1:10000 z &lt;- 1.5 # approach 1: loop multiplication &lt;- function(x,z) { result &lt;- c() for (i in 1:length(x)) {result &lt;- c(result, x[i]*z)} return(result) } result &lt;- multiplication(x,z) head(result) ## [1] 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0 7.5 9.0 # approach II: &quot;R-style&quot; result2 &lt;- x * z head(result2) ## [1] 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0 7.5 9.0 # comparison benchmarking &lt;- mark( result &lt;- multiplication(x,z), result2 &lt;- x * z, min_iterations = 50 ) benchmarking[, 4:9] ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 12.9 382MB 10.1 ## 2 76370. 78.2KB 7.64 In addition, the bench package provides a simple way to visualize these outputs: plot(benchmarking, type = &quot;boxplot&quot;) Finally, to analyze the performance of your entire script/program the profvis package provides visual summaries to quickly detect the most prominent bottle necks. You can either call this via the profvis() function with the code section to be profiled as argument, or via the RStudio user interface by clicking on the Code Tools menu in the editor window and select “Profile selected lines”. # load package library(profvis) # analyse performance of several lines of code profvis({ x &lt;- 1:10000 z &lt;- 1.5 # approach 1: loop multiplication &lt;- function(x,z) { result &lt;- c() for (i in 1:length(x)) {result &lt;- c(result, x[i]*z)} return(result) } result &lt;- multiplication(x,z) # approach II: &quot;R-style&quot; result2 &lt;- x * z head(result2) }) 4.3 Writing efficient R code This subsection touches upon several prominent aspects of writing efficient/fast R code.12 4.3.1 Memory allocation and growing objects R tends to “grow” already initiated objects in memory when they are modified. At the initiation of the object a small amount of memory is occupied at some location in memory. In simple terms, once the object grows, it might not have enough space where it is currently located. Hence, it needs to be “moved” to another location in memory with more space available. This moving, or “re-allocation” of memory, needs time and slows down the overall process. This potential is most practically illustrated with a for-loop in which each iteration’s result is stored as an element of a vector (the object in question). To avoid growing this object, you need to instruct R to pre-allocate the memory necessary to contain the final result. If we don’t do that, each iteration of the loop causes R to re-allocate memory because the number of elements in the vector/list is changing. In simple terms, this means that R needs to execute more steps in each iteration. In the following example, we compare the performance of two functions. One taking this principle into account, the other not. The functions take a numeric vector as input and return the square root of each element of the numeric vector. # naïve implementation sqrt_vector &lt;- function(x) { output &lt;- c() for (i in 1:length(x)) { output &lt;- c(output, x[i]^(1/2)) } return(output) } # implementation with pre-allocation of memory sqrt_vector_faster &lt;- function(x) { output &lt;- rep(NA, length(x)) for (i in 1:length(x)) { output[i] &lt;- x[i]^(1/2) } return(output) } As a proof of concept we use system.time() to measure the difference in speed for various input sizes.13 # the different sizes of the vectors we will put into the two functions input_sizes &lt;- seq(from = 100, to = 10000, by = 100) # create the input vectors inputs &lt;- sapply(input_sizes, rnorm) # compute outputs for each of the functions output_slower &lt;- sapply(inputs, function(x){ system.time(sqrt_vector(x))[&quot;elapsed&quot;] } ) output_faster &lt;- sapply(inputs, function(x){ system.time(sqrt_vector_faster(x))[&quot;elapsed&quot;] } ) The following plot shows the difference in the performance of the two functions. # load packages library(ggplot2) # initiate data frame for plot plotdata &lt;- data.frame(time_elapsed = c(output_slower, output_faster), input_size = c(input_sizes, input_sizes), Implementation= c(rep(&quot;sqrt_vector&quot;, length(output_slower)), rep(&quot;sqrt_vector_faster&quot;, length(output_faster)))) # plot ggplot(plotdata, aes(x=input_size, y= time_elapsed)) + geom_point(aes(colour=Implementation)) + theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Time elapsed (in seconds)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;No. of elements processed&quot;) Clearly, the version with pre-allocation of memory (avoiding growing an object) is overall much faster. In addition, we see that the problem with the growing object in the naive implementation tends to get worse with each iteration. The take-away message for the practitioner: if possible, always initiate the “container” object (list, matrix, etc.) for iteration results as an empty object of the final size/dimensions. The attentive reader and experienced R coder will have noticed by this point, that both of the functions implemented above are not really smart practice to solve the problem at hand. If you consider yourself part of this group the next subsection will make you more comfortable. 4.3.2 Vectorization in basic R functions We can further improve the performance of this function by exploiting a particular characteristic of R: in R ‘everything is a vector’ and many of the most basic R functions (such as math operators) are vectorized. In simple terms, this means that an operation is implemented to directly work on vectors in such a way that it can take advantage of the similarity of each of the vector’s elements. That is, R only has to figure out once how to apply a given function to a vector element in order to apply it to all elements of the vector. In a simple loop, R has to go through the same ‘preparatory’ steps again and again in each iteration. Following up on the problem from the previous subsection, we implement an additional function called sqrt_vector_fastest that exploits the fact that math operators in R are vectorized functions. We then re-run the same speed test as above with this function. # implementation with vectorization sqrt_vector_fastest &lt;- function(x) { output &lt;- x^(1/2) return(output) } # speed test output_fastest &lt;- sapply(inputs, function(x){ system.time(sqrt_vector_fastest(x))[&quot;elapsed&quot;] } ) Let’s have a look at whether this improves the function’s performance further. # load packages library(ggplot2) # initiate data frame for plot plotdata &lt;- data.frame(time_elapsed = c(output_faster, output_fastest), input_size = c(input_sizes, input_sizes), Implementation= c(rep(&quot;sqrt_vector_faster&quot;, length(output_faster)), rep(&quot;sqrt_vector_fastest&quot;, length(output_fastest)))) # plot ggplot(plotdata, aes(x=time_elapsed, y=Implementation)) + geom_boxplot(aes(colour=Implementation), show.legend = FALSE) + theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + xlab(&quot;Time elapsed (in seconds)&quot;) Clearly, the vectorized implementation is even faster. The take-away message: make use of vectorized basic R functions where possible. At this point you might wonder: why not always use vectorization over loops, when working with R? This question (and closely related similar questions) have been fiercely debated in the R online community over the last few years. Also the debate contains and has contained several (in my view) slightly misleading arguments. A simple answer to this question is: it is in fact not that simple to use actual vectorization for every kind of problem in r. There are a number of functions often mentioned to achieve “vectorization” easily in R, however, they do not actually implement actual vectorization in its original technical sense (the type just demonstrated here with the R math operators). Since this point is very prominent in debates about how to improve R code, the next subsection attempts to summarize the most important aspects to keep in mind. 4.3.3 apply-type functions and vectorization There are basically two ways to make use of some form of “vectorization” instead of writing loops. One approach is to use an apply-type function instead of loops. Note though, that the apply-type functions primarily make the writing of code more efficient. They still run a loop under the hood. Nevertheless, some apply-type functions might still outperform an explicit loops as they are might be better implemented.14 Consider, for example, lapply(), a function that takes a vector (atomic or list) as input and applies a function FUN to each of its elements. It is a straightforward alternative to for-loops in many situations (and it automatically takes care of the “growing objects” problem discussed above). The following example shows how we can get the same result by either writing a loop or using lapply(). The aim of the code example is to import the Health News in Twitter Data Set by Karami et al. (2017). The raw data consists of several text files that need to be imported to R consecutively. The text-files are located in data/twitter_texts/. For either approach of importing all of these files, we first need a list of the paths to all of the files. We can get this with list.files(). Also, for either approach we will make use of the fread-function in the data.table-package. # load packages library(data.table) # get a list of all file-paths textfiles &lt;- list.files(&quot;data/twitter_texts&quot;, full.names = TRUE) Now we can read in all the text files with a for-loop as follows. # prepare loop all_texts &lt;- list() n_files &lt;- length(textfiles) length(all_texts) &lt;- n_files # read all files listed in textfiles for (i in 1:n_files) { all_texts[[i]] &lt;- fread(textfiles[i]) } The imported files are now stored as data.table-objects in the list all_texts. With the following line of code we combine all of them in one data.table. # combine all in one data.table twitter_text &lt;- rbindlist(all_texts) # check result str(twitter_text) ## Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 42422 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ V1:integer64 585978391360221184 585947808772960257 585947807816650752 585866060991078401 585794106170839041 585733482413891584 585733481608646657 585701601131765761 ... ## $ V2: chr &quot;Thu Apr 09 01:31:50 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 23:30:18 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 23:30:18 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 18:05:28 +0000 2015&quot; ... ## $ V3: chr &quot;Breast cancer risk test devised http://bbc.in/1CimpJF&quot; &quot;GP workload harming care - BMA poll http://bbc.in/1ChTBRv&quot; &quot;Short people&#39;s &#39;heart risk greater&#39; http://bbc.in/1ChTANp&quot; &quot;New approach against HIV &#39;promising&#39; http://bbc.in/1E6jAjt&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; Alternatively, we can make use of lapply as follows in order to achieve exactly the same. # use lapply instead of loop all_texts &lt;- lapply(textfiles, fread) # combine all in one data.table twitter_text &lt;- rbindlist(all_texts) # check result str(twitter_text) ## Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 42422 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ V1:integer64 585978391360221184 585947808772960257 585947807816650752 585866060991078401 585794106170839041 585733482413891584 585733481608646657 585701601131765761 ... ## $ V2: chr &quot;Thu Apr 09 01:31:50 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 23:30:18 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 23:30:18 +0000 2015&quot; &quot;Wed Apr 08 18:05:28 +0000 2015&quot; ... ## $ V3: chr &quot;Breast cancer risk test devised http://bbc.in/1CimpJF&quot; &quot;GP workload harming care - BMA poll http://bbc.in/1ChTBRv&quot; &quot;Short people&#39;s &#39;heart risk greater&#39; http://bbc.in/1ChTANp&quot; &quot;New approach against HIV &#39;promising&#39; http://bbc.in/1E6jAjt&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; Finally, we can make use of Vectorization() in order to “vectorize” our own import function (written for this example).

Another potential problem of using up more memory than necessary during an execution of an R-script, is how R handles objects/variables and their names. Consider the following line of code. a &lt;- runif(10000) what is usually said to describe what is happening here is something along the lines of “we initiate a variable called a and assign a numeric vector with 10,000 random numbers. What in fact happens is that the name a is assigned to the integer vector (which in turn exists at a specific memory address). Thus values do not have names but names have values. This has important consequences for memory allocation and performance. For example, because a is in fact just a name attached to a value, the following does not involve any copying of values. It simply”binds” another name, b, to the same value to which a is already bound. b &lt;- a We can prove this in two ways. First, if what I just stated was not true, the line above would actually lead to more memory being occupied by the current R session. However, this is not the case: object_size(a) ## 80.05 kB mem_change(c &lt;- a) ## -309 kB Second, we can see that the values to which a and b are bound are stored at the same memory address. Hence, they are the same values. # load packages library(lobstr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lobstr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:pryr&#39;: ## ## ast, mem_used # check memory addresses of objects obj_addr(a) ## [1] &quot;0x5555ac6893f0&quot; obj_addr(b) ## [1] &quot;0x5555ac6893f0&quot; Now you probably wonder, what happens to b if we modify a. After all, if the values to which b is bound are changed when we write code concerning a, we might end up with very surprising output. The answer is, and this is key (!), once we modify a, the values need to be copied in order to ensure the integrity of b. Only at this point, our program will require more memory. # check the first element&#39;s value a[1] ## [1] 0.07497 b[1] ## [1] 0.07497 # modify a, check memory change mem_change(a[1] &lt;- 0) ## 79 kB # check memory addresses obj_addr(a) ## [1] &quot;0x5555ac781ec0&quot; obj_addr(b) ## [1] &quot;0x5555ac6893f0&quot; Note that the entire vector needed to be copied for this. There is, of course, a lesson from all this regarding writing efficient code. Knowing how actual copying of values does occur helps avoiding unnecessary copying. The larger an object, the more time it will take to copy it in memory. Objects with a single binding get modified in place (no copying): mem_change(d &lt;- runif(10000)) ## 80.2 kB mem_change(d[1] &lt;- 0) ## 584 B 4.3.5 Releasing memory Closely related to the issue of copy-upon-modify, is the issue of “releasing” memory via “garbage collection”. If your program uses up a lot of (too much) memory (typical for working with large data sets), all processes on your computer might substantially slow down (we will look more closely into why this is the case in the next chapter). Hence, you might want to remove/delete an object once you do not need it anymore. This can be done with the rm() function. mem_change(large_vector &lt;- runif(10^8)) ## 800 MB mem_change(rm(large_vector)) ## -800 MB rm() removes objects that are currently accessible in the global R environment. However, some objects/values might technically not be visible/accessible anymore (for example, objects that have been created in a function which has since returned the function output). To also release memory occupied by these objects you can call gc() (the garbage collector). While R will automatically collect the garbage once it is close to running out of memory, explicitly calling gc can still improve the performance of your script when working with large data sets. This is in particular the case when R is not the only data-intense process running on your computer. For example, when running an R script involving the repeated querying of data from a local SQL database and the subsequent memory-intense processing of this data in R, you can avoid using up too much memory by running rm and gc explicitly.15 4.3.6 Beyond R So far, we have explored idiosyncrasies of R we should be aware of when writing programs to handle and analyze large data sets. While this has shown that R has many advantages for working with data, it also revealed some aspects of R that might result in low performance compared other programming languages. A simple generic explanation for this is that R is an interpreted language, meaning that when we execute R code, it is processed (statement by statement) by an ‘interpreter’ that translates the code into machine code (without the user giving any specific instructions). In contrast, when writing code in a ‘compiled language’, we first have to explicitly compile the code and then run the compiled program. Running code that is already compiled is typically much faster than running R code that has to be interpreted before it can actually be processed by the CPU. For advanced programmers, R offers various options to directly make use of compiled programs (for example, written in C, C++, or FORTRAN). In fact several of the core R functions installed with the basic R distribution are implemented in one of these lower-level programming languages and the R function we call simply interacts with these functions. We can actually investigate this by looking at the source code of an R function. When simply typing the name of a function (such as our import_file()) to the console, R is printing the function’s source code to the console. import_file ## function(x) { ## parsed_x &lt;- fread(x) ## return(parsed_x) ## } ## &lt;bytecode: 0x5555e63a9c08&gt; However, if we do the same for function sum, we don’t see any actual source code. sum ## function (..., na.rm = FALSE) .Primitive(&quot;sum&quot;) Instead .Primitive() indicates that sum() is actually referring to an internal function (in this case implemented in C). While the use of functions implemented in a lower-level language is a common technique to improve the speed of ‘R’ functions, it is particularly prominent in the context of functions/packages made to deal with large amounts of data (such as the data.table package). 4.4 SQL basics Are tomorrow’s bigger computers going to solve the problem? For some people, yes—their data will stay the same size and computers will get big enough to hold it comfortably. For other people it will only get worse—more powerful computers means extraordinarily larger datasets. If you are likely to be in this latter group, you might want to get used to working with databases now. (Burns 2011) The Structured Query Language (SQL) has become a bread-and-butter tool for data analysts and data scientists due to its broad application in systems used to store large amounts of data. While traditionally only encountered in the context of structured data stored in relational database management systems, some versions of it are now also used to query data from data warehouse systems (e.g. Amazon Redshift) and even to query massive amounts (terabytes or even petabytes) of data stored in data lakes (e.g., Amazon Athena). In all of these applications, SQL’s purpose (from the data analytics’ perspective) is to provide a convenient and efficient way to query data from mass storage for analysis. Instead of importing a CSV file into R and then filtering it in order to get to the analytic data set, we use SQL to express how the analytic data set should look like (which variables and rows should be included). The latter point is very important to keep in mind when already having experience with a language like R and learning SQL for the first time. In R we write code to instruct the computer what to do with the data. For example, we tell it to import a csv file called economics.csv as a data.table, then we instruct it to remove observations which are older than a certain date according to the date column, then we instruct it to compute the average of the unemploy column values for each year based on the date column and then return the result as a separate data frame. # import data econ &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/economics.csv&quot;) # filter econ2 &lt;- econ[&quot;1968-01-01&quot;&lt;=econ$date,] # compute yearly averages (basic R approach) econ2$year &lt;- lubridate::year(econ2$date) years &lt;- unique(econ2$year) averages &lt;- sapply(years, FUN = function(x) mean(econ2[econ2$year==x,&quot;unemploy&quot;])) output &lt;- data.frame(year=years, average_unemploy=averages) # inspect the first few lines of the result head(output) ## year average_unemploy ## 1 1968 2797 ## 2 1969 2830 ## 3 1970 4127 ## 4 1971 5022 ## 5 1972 4876 ## 6 1973 4359 In contrast, when using SQL we write code that describes how the final result is supposed to look like. The SQL engine processing the code then takes care of the rest and returns the result in the most efficient way.16 SELECT strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, `date`) AS year, AVG(unemploy) AS average_unemploy FROM econ WHERE &quot;1968-01-01&quot;&lt;=`date` GROUP BY year LIMIT 6; Table 4.1: 6 records year average_unemploy 1968 2797 1969 2830 1970 4127 1971 5022 1972 4876 1973 4359 For the moment, we will only focus on the code and ignore the underlying hardware and database concepts (those will be discussed in more detail in chapter 5). 4.4.1 First steps in SQL(ite) In order to get familiar with coding in SQL, we work with a free and easy-to-use version of SQL called SQLite. SQLite is a free full-featured SQL database engine widely used across platforms. It comes usually pre-installed with Windows and Mac/OSX distributions and has (from the user’s perspective) all the core features of more sophisticated SQL versions. Unlike the more sophisticated SQL systems, SQLite does not rely explicitly on a client/server-model. That is, there is no need to set up your database on a server and then query it from a client interface. In fact, setting it up is straightforward. In the terminal, we can directly call SQLite as a command-line tool (on most modern computers the command is now sqlite3, SQLite version 3). In this first code example, we set up an SQLite database using the command line. In the file structure of the book repository, we first switch to the data directory. cd data With one simple command, we start up SQLite, create a new database called mydb.sqlite and connect to the newly created database.17 sqlite3 mydb.sqlite This created a new file mydb.sqlite in our data directory which contains the newly created database. And, we are now running sqlite in the terminal (indicated with the sqlite&gt;. This means we can now type SQL code in the terminal to run queries and other SQL commands. At this point, the newly created database does not contain any data yet. There are no tables in it. We can see this by running the .tables command. .tables As expected, nothing is returned. Now, let’s create our first table and import the economics.csv data set to it. In SQLite, it makes sense to first set up an empty table in which all column data types are defined before importing data from a CSV-file to it. If a CSV is directly imported to a new table (without type definitions), all columns will be set to TEXT (similar to character in R) by default. Setting the right data type for each variable follows essentially the same logic as setting the data types of a data frame’s columns in R (with the difference that in SQL this also affects how the data is stored on disk).18 In a first step, we thus create a new table called econ. -- Create the new table CREATE TABLE econ( &quot;date&quot; DATE, &quot;pce&quot; REAL, &quot;pop&quot; REAL, &quot;psavert&quot; REAL, &quot;uempmed&quot; REAL, &quot;unemploy&quot; INTEGER ); Then, we can import the data from the csv file, by first switching to CSV mode via the command .mode csv and then importing the data to econ with .import. The .import command expects as a first argument the path to the CSV file on disk and as a second argument the name of the table to import the data to. -- prepare import .mode csv -- import data from csv .import --skip 1 economics.csv econ Now we can have a look at the new database table in SQLite. .tables shows that we now have one table called econ in our database and .schema displays the structure of the new econ table. .tables # econ .schema econ { sql12, connection=con, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE} # CREATE TABLE econ( # \"date\" DATE, # \"pce\" REAL, # \"pop\" REAL, # \"psavert\" REAL, # \"uempmed\" REAL, # \"unemploy\" INTEGER # ); With this, we can start querying data with SQLite. In order to make the query results easier to read, we first set two options regarding how query results are displayed in the terminal. .header on enables the display of the column names in the returned query results. And .mode columns arranges the query results in columns. .header on .mode columns In our first query, we select all (*) variable values of the observation of January 1968. select * from econ where date = &#39;1968-01-01&#39;; Table 4.2: 1 records date pce pop psavert uempmed unemploy 1968-01-01 531.5 199808 11.7 5.1 2878 4.4.1.1 Simple queries Now let’s select all dates and unemployment values of observations with more than 15 million unemployed, ordered by date. select date, unemploy from econ where unemploy &gt; 15000 order by date; Table 4.3: 9 records date unemploy 2009-09-01 15009 2009-10-01 15352 2009-11-01 15219 2009-12-01 15098 2010-01-01 15046 2010-02-01 15113 2010-03-01 15202 2010-04-01 15325 2010-11-01 15081 4.4.2 Joins So far, we have only considered queries involving one table of data. However, SQL provides a very efficient way to join data from various tables. Again, the way of writing SQL code is the same: you describe how the final table should look like and from where the data is to be selected. Let’s extend the previous example by importing an additional table to our mydb.sqlite. The additional data is stored in the file inflation.csv in the book’s data folder and contains information on the US yearly inflation rate measured in percent.19 -- Create the new table CREATE TABLE inflation( &quot;date&quot; DATE, &quot;inflation_percent&quot; REAL ); -- prepare import .mode csv -- import data from csv .import --skip 1 inflation.csv inflation -- switch back to column mode .mode columns Note that the data stored in econ contains monthly observations, while inflation contains yearly observations. We can thus only meaningfully combine the two data sets at the level of years. Again using the combination of data sets in R as a reference point, here is what we would like to achieve expressed in R. The aim is to get a table that serves as basis for a Phillips curve plot, with yearly observations and the variables year, average_unemp_percent, and inflation_percent. # import data econ &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/economics.csv&quot;) inflation &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/inflation.csv&quot;) # prepare variable to match observations econ$year &lt;- lubridate::year(econ$date) inflation$year &lt;- lubridate::year(inflation$date) # create final output years &lt;- unique(econ$year) averages &lt;- sapply(years, FUN = function(x) { mean(econ[econ$year==x,&quot;unemploy&quot;]/econ[econ$year==x,&quot;pop&quot;])*100 } ) unemp &lt;- data.frame(year=years, average_unemp_percent=averages) # combine via the year column # keep all rows of econ output&lt;- merge(unemp, inflation[, c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;inflation_percent&quot;)], by=&quot;year&quot;) # inspect output head(output) ## year average_unemp_percent inflation_percent ## 1 1967 1.512 2.773 ## 2 1968 1.394 4.272 ## 3 1969 1.396 5.462 ## 4 1970 2.013 5.838 ## 5 1971 2.419 4.293 ## 6 1972 2.324 3.272 Now let’s look at how the same table can be created in SQLite. SELECT strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, econ.date) AS year, AVG(unemploy/pop)*100 AS average_unemp_percent, inflation_percent FROM econ INNER JOIN inflation ON year = strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, inflation.date) GROUP BY year Table 4.4: Displaying records 1 - 6 year average_unemp_percent inflation_percent 1967 1.512 2.773 1968 1.394 4.272 1969 1.397 5.462 1970 2.013 5.838 1971 2.419 4.293 1972 2.324 3.272 When done working with the database, we can exit SQLite with the .quit command. 4.5 Wrapping up Find bottlenecks in your code, before exposing it to the full dataset. To do so, use tools like bench::mark() and profvis::profvis() to see how long certain parts of your code need to process and how much memory they occupy. Be aware of R’s strengths and weaknesses when writing code for big data analytics. In particular, pre-allocate memory for objects in which you collect the results of loops, make use of R’s vectorization, and avoid unnecessary copying of objects. Get familiar with basic SQL and the underlying concept of only loading those observations and variables into the R environment (RAM), which are really needed for your analysis task. SQLite in combination with R is an excellent lightweight solution to do this.

We then look at each of these components (and additional specialized components) through the lens of Big Data. That is, for each component, we look at how it can become a crucial bottleneck when processing large amounts of data and what we can do about it in R. First we focus on mass storage and memory, then on the CPU, and finally on new alternatives to the CPU. 5.1 Mass storage In a simple computing environment, the mass storage device (hard disk) is where the data is stored to be analyzed. So, in what units do we measure the size of datasets and consequently the mass storage capacity of a computer? The smallest unit of information in computing/digital data is called a bit (from binary digit; abbrev. ‘b’) and can take one of two (symbolic) values, either a 0 or a 1 (“off” or “on”). Consider, for example, the decimal number 139. Written in the binary system, 139 corresponds to the binary number 10001011. In order to store this number on a hard disk, we require a capacity of 8 bits, or one byte (1 byte = 8 bits; abbrev. ‘B’). Historically, one byte encoded a single character of text (i.e., in the ASCII character encoding system). When thinking of a given dataset in its raw/binary representation, we can simply think of it as a row of 0s and 1s. Bigger units for storage capacity usually build on bytes, for example: \\(1 \\text{ kilobyte (KB)} = 1000^{1} \\approx 2^{10} \\text{ bytes}\\) \\(1 \\text{ megabyte (MB)} = 1000^{2} \\approx 2^{20} \\text{ bytes}\\) \\(1 \\text{ gigabyte (GB)} = 1000^{3} \\approx 2^{30} \\text{ bytes}\\) Currently, a common laptop or desktop computer has several hundred GBs of mass storage capacity. The problems related to a lack of mass storage capacity in Big Data analytics are likely the easiest to understand. Suppose you collect large amounts of data from an online source such as the Twitter API (application programming interface). At some point, R will throw an error and stop the data collection procedure as the operating system will not allow R to use up more disk space. The simplest solution to this problem is to clean up your hard disk: empty the trash, archive files in the cloud or on an external drive and delete them on the main disk, etc. In addition, there are some easy-to-learn tricks to use from within R to save some disk space. 5.1.1 Avoid redundancies Different formats for structuring data stored on disk use up more or less space. A simple example is the comparison of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and CSV (Comma Separated Values) – both data structures that are widely used to store data for analytics purposes. JSON is much more flexible in that it allows the definition of arbitrarily complex hierarchical data structures (and even allows for hints at data types). However, this flexibility comes with some overhead in the usage of special characters to define the structure. Consider the following JSON excerpt of an economic time series fetched from the Federal Reserve’s FRED API. { &quot;realtime_start&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;realtime_end&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;observation_start&quot;: &quot;1776-07-04&quot;, &quot;observation_end&quot;: &quot;9999-12-31&quot;, &quot;units&quot;: &quot;lin&quot;, &quot;output_type&quot;: 1, &quot;file_type&quot;: &quot;json&quot;, &quot;order_by&quot;: &quot;observation_date&quot;, &quot;sort_order&quot;: &quot;asc&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: 84, &quot;offset&quot;: 0, &quot;limit&quot;: 100000, &quot;observations&quot;: [ { &quot;realtime_start&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;realtime_end&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;1929-01-01&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1065.9&quot; }, { &quot;realtime_start&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;realtime_end&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;1930-01-01&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;975.5&quot; }, ..., { &quot;realtime_start&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;realtime_end&quot;: &quot;2013-08-14&quot;, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2012-01-01&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;15693.1&quot; } ] } The JSON format is very practical here in separating metadata (such as what time frame is covered by this dataset, etc.) in the first few lines on top from the actual data in \"observations\" further down. However, note that due to this structure, the key names like \"date\", and \"value\" occur for each observation in that time series. In addition, \"realtime_start\" and \"realtime_end\" occur both in the metadata section and again in each observation. Each of those occurrences costs some bytes of storage space on your hard disk but does not add any information once you have parsed and imported the time series into R. The same information could also be stored in a more efficient way on your hard disk by simply storing the metadata in a separate text file and the actual observations in a CSV file (in a table-like structure): &quot;date&quot;,&quot;value&quot; &quot;1929-01-01&quot;, &quot;1065.9&quot; &quot;1930-01-01&quot;, &quot;975.5&quot; ..., &quot;2012-01-01&quot;, 15693.1&quot; In fact, in that particular example, storing the data in JSON format would take up more than double the hard-disk space as CSV. Of course, this is not to say that one should generally store data in CSV files. In many situations, you might really have to rely on JSON’s flexibility to represent more complex structures. However, in practice it is very much worthwhile to think about whether you can improve storage efficiency by simply storing raw data in a different format. Another related point to storing data in CSV files is to remove redundancies by splitting the data into several tables/CSV files, whereby each table contains the variables exclusively describing the type of observation in it. For example, when analyzing customer data for marketing purposes, the dataset stored in one CSV file might be at the level of individual purchases. That is, each row contains both information on what has been purchased on which day by which customer as well as additional variables describing the customer (such as customer id, name, address, etc.). Instead of keeping all of this data in one file, we could split it into two files, where one only contains the order ids and corresponding customer ids as well as attributes of individual orders (but not additional attributes of the customers themselves) and the other contains the customer ids and all customer attributes. Thereby, we avoid redundancies in the form of repeatedly storing the same values of customer attributes (like name and address) for each order.20 5.1.2 Data compression Data compression essentially follows from the same basic idea of avoiding redundancies in data storage as the simple approaches discussed above. However, it happens on a much more fundamental level. Data compression algorithms encode the information contained in the original representation of the data with fewer bits. In the case of lossless compression, this results in a new data file containing the exact same information but taking up less space on disk. In simple terms, compression replaces repeatedly occurring sequences with shorter expressions and keeps track of replacements in a table. Based on the table, the file can then be de-compressed to recreate the original representation of the data. For example, consider the following character string. &quot;xxxxxyyyyyzzzz&quot; The same data could be represented with fewer bits as: &quot;5x6y4z&quot; which needs fewer than half the number of bits to be stored (but contains the same information). There are several easy ways to use your mass storage capacity more efficiently with data compression in R. Most conveniently, some functions to import/export data in R directly allow for reading and writing of compressed formats. For example, the fread()/fwrite() functions provided in the data.table package will automatically use the GZIP (de-)compression utility when writing to (reading from) a CSV file with a .gz file extension in the file name. # load packages library(data.table) # load example data from basic R installation data(&quot;LifeCycleSavings&quot;) # write data to normal csv file and check size fwrite(LifeCycleSavings, file=&quot;lcs.csv&quot;) file.size(&quot;lcs.csv&quot;) ## [1] 1441 # write data to a GZIPped (compressed) csv file and check size fwrite(LifeCycleSavings, file=&quot;lcs.csv.gz&quot;) file.size(&quot;lcs.csv.gz&quot;) ## [1] 744 # read/import the compressed data lcs &lt;- data.table::fread(&quot;lcs.csv.gz&quot;) Alternatively, you can also use other types of data compression as follows. # common ZIP compression (independent of data.table package) write.csv(LifeCycleSavings, file=&quot;lcs.csv&quot;) file.size(&quot;lcs.csv&quot;) ## [1] 1984 zip(zipfile = &quot;lcs.csv.zip&quot;, files = &quot;lcs.csv&quot;) file.size(&quot;lcs.csv.zip&quot;) ## [1] 1205 # unzip/decompress and read/import data lcs_path &lt;- unzip(&quot;lcs.csv.zip&quot;) lcs &lt;- read.csv(lcs_path) Note that data compression is subject to a time–memory trade-off. Compression and de-compression is computationally intense and needs time. When using compression in order to make more efficient use of the available mass storage capacity, think about how frequently you expect the data to be loaded into R as part of the data analysis tasks ahead and for how long your will need to keep the data stored on your hard disk. Importing GBs of compressed data can be uncomfortably slower than importing from a decompressed file. So far, we have only focused on data size in the context of mass storage capacity. But what happens once you load a large dataset into R (e.g., by means of read.csv())? A program called a “parser” is executed that reads the raw data from the hard disk and creates a representation of that data in the R environment, that is, in random access memory (RAM). All common computers have more GBs of mass storage available than GBs of RAM. Hence, new issues of hardware capacity loom at the stage of data import, which brings us to the next subsection. 5.2 Random access memory (RAM) Currently, a common laptop or desktop computer has 8–32 GB of RAM capacity. These are more-or-less the numbers you should keep in the back of your mind for the examples/discussions that follow. That is, we will consider a dataset as “big” if it takes up several GBs in RAM (and therefore might overwhelm a machine with 8GB RAM capacity). There are several types of problems that you might run into in practice when attempting to import and analyze a dataset of the size close to or larger than your computer’s RAM capacity. First, importing the data might take much longer than expected, your computer might freeze during import (or later during the analysis), R/Rstudio might crash, or you might get an error message hinting at a lack of RAM. How can you anticipate such problems, and what can you do about them? Many of the techniques and packages discussed in the following chapters are in one way or another solutions to these kinds of problems. However, there are a few relatively simple things to keep in mind before we go into the details. The same data stored on the mass storage device (e.g., in a CSV file) might take up more or less space in RAM. This is due to the fact that the data is (technically speaking) structured differently in a CSV or JSON file than in, for example, a data table or a matrix in R. For example, it is reasonable to anticipate that the example JSON file with the economic time series data will take up less space as a time series object in R (in RAM) than it does on the hard disk (for one thing just simply due to the fact that we will not keep the redundancies mentioned before). The import might work well, but some parts of the data analysis script might require much more memory to run through even without loading additional data from disk. A classic example of this is regression analysis performed with, for example, lm() in R. As part of the OLS estimation procedure, lm will need to create the model matrix (usually denoted \\(X\\)). Depending on the model you want to estimate, the model matrix might actually be larger than the data frame containing the dataset. In fact, this can happen quite easily if you specify a fixed effects model in which you want to account for the fixed effects via dummy variables (for example, for each country except for one).21 Again, the result can be one of several: an error message hinting at a lack of memory, a crash, or the computer slowing down significantly. Anticipating these types of problems is very tricky since memory problems are often caused at a lower level of a function from the package that provides you with the data analytics routine you intend to use. Accordingly, error messages can be rather cryptic. Keep in mind that you have some leeway to guide how much space imported data takes up in R by considering data structures and data types. For example, you can use factors instead of character vectors when importing categorical variables into R (the default in read.csv), and for some operations it makes sense to work with matrices instead of data frames. Finally, recall the lessons regarding memory usage from the section “Writing efficient R code” in Chapter 1. 5.3 Combining RAM and hard disk: virtual memory What if all the RAM in our computer is not enough to store all the data we want to analyze? Modern operating systems (OSs) have a way of dealing with such a situation. Once all RAM is used up by the currently running programs, the OS allocates parts of the memory back to the hard disk, which then works as virtual memory. Figure @refVirtual memory. Overall memory is mapped to RAM and parts of the hard disk. illustrates this point. Figure 5.1: Virtual memory. Overall memory is mapped to RAM and parts of the hard disk. For example, when we implement an R-script that imports one file after the other into the R environment, ignoring the RAM capacity of our computer, the OS will start paging data to the virtual memory. This happens ‘under the hood’ without explicit instructions by the user. We will quite likely notice that the computer slows down a lot when this happens. While this default usage of virtual memory by the OS is helpful for running several applications at the same time, each taking up a moderate amount of memory, it is not a really useful tool for processing large amounts of data in one application (R). However, the underlying idea of using both RAM and mass storage simultaneously in order to cope with a lack of memory is very useful in the context of Big Data analytics. Several R packages have been developed that exploit the idea behind virtual memory explicitly for analyzing large amounts of data. The basic idea behind these packages is to map a dataset to the hard disk when loading it into R. The actual data values are stored in chunks on the hard disk, while the structure/metadata of the dataset is loaded into R. 5.4 CPU and parallelization The actual processing of the data is done in the computer’s central processing unit (CPU). Consequently, the performance of the CPU has a substantial effect on how fast a data analytics task runs. A CPU’s performance is usually denoted by its clock rate measured in gigaherz (GHz). In simple terms, a CPU with a clock rate of 4.8 GHz can execute 4.8 billion basic operations per second. Holding all other aspects constant, you can thus expect an analytics task to run faster if it runs on a computer with higher CPU clock rate. Alternatively to scaling up the CPU, we can exploit the fact that modern CPUs have several cores. In the normal usage of a PC, the operating system makes use of these cores to run several applications smoothly in parallel (e.g., you listen to music on Spotify while browsing the web and running some analytics script in RStudio in the background). Modern computing environments such as R allow us to explicitly run parts of the same analytics task in parallel, that is, on several CPU cores at the same time. Following the same logic, we can also connect several computers (each with several CPU cores) in a cluster computer and run the program in parallel on all of these computing nodes. Both of these approaches are generally referred to as parallelization and both are supported in several R packages. An R program run in parallel typically involves the following steps First, several instances of R are running at the same time (across one machine with multiple CPU cores or across a cluster computer). One of the instances (i.e., the master instance) breaks the computation into batches and sends those to the other instances. Second, each of the instances processes its batch and sends the results back to the master instance. Finally, the master instance combines the partial results into the final result and returns it to the user. To illustrate this point, consider the following econometric problem: you have a customer dataset with detailed data on customer characteristics, past customer behavior, and information on online marketing campaigns. Your task is to figure out which customers are more likely to react positively to the most recent online marketing campaign. The aim is to optimize personalized marketing campaigns in the future based on insights gained from this exercise. In a first step you take a computationally intense “brute force” approach: you run all possible regressions with the dependent variable Response (equal to 1 if the customer took the offer in the campaign and 0 otherwise). In total you have 21 independent variables, thus you need to run \\(2^20=1,048,576\\) logit regressions (this is without considering linear combinations of covariates etc.). Finally, you want to select the model with the best fit according to deviance. A simple sequential implementation to solve this problem could look like this (for the sake of time, we cap the number of regression models to N=10). # you can download the dataset from # https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data? # select=marketing_data.csv # PREPARATION ----------------------------- # packages library(stringr) # import data marketing &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/marketing_data.csv&quot;) # clean/prepare data marketing$Income &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, marketing$Income)) marketing$days_customer &lt;- as.Date(Sys.Date())- as.Date(marketing$Dt_Customer, &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;) marketing$Dt_Customer &lt;- NULL # all sets of independent vars indep &lt;- names(marketing)[ c(2:19, 27,28)] combinations_list &lt;- lapply(1:length(indep), function(x) combn(indep, x, simplify = FALSE)) combinations_list &lt;- unlist(combinations_list, recursive = FALSE) models &lt;- lapply(combinations_list, function(x) paste(&quot;Response ~&quot;, paste(x, collapse=&quot;+&quot;))) # COMPUTE REGRESSIONS -------------------------- N &lt;- 10 # N &lt;- length(models) for all pseudo_Rsq &lt;- list() length(pseudo_Rsq) &lt;- N for (i in 1:N) { # fit the logit model via maximum likelihood fit &lt;- glm(models[[i]], data=marketing, family = binomial()) # compute the proportion of deviance explained by # the independent vars (~R^2) pseudo_Rsq[[i]] &lt;- 1-(fit$deviance/fit$null.deviance) } # SELECT THE WINNER --------------- models[[which.max(pseudo_Rsq)]] ## [1] &quot;Response ~ MntWines&quot; 5.4.1 Naive multi-session approach There is actually a simple way of doing this “manually” on a multi-core PC, which intuitively illustrates the point of parallelization (although it would not be a very practical approach): you write an R script that loads the dataset, runs the fist \\(n\\) of the total of \\(N\\) regressions and stores the result in a local text file. Next, you run the script in your current RStudio session, open an additional RStudio session and run the script with the next \\(n\\) regressions, and so on until all cores are occupied with one RStudio session. At the end you collect all of the results from the separate text files and combine them to get the final result. Depending on the problem at hand, this could indeed speed up the overall task, and it is technically speaking a form of “multi-session” approach. However, as you have surely noticed, this is unlikely to be a very practical approach. 5.4.2 Multi-core and multi-node approach A more practical approach is to write one R script (with the help of some specialized packages) that instructs R to automatically distribute the batches to different cores (or different computing nodes in a cluster computer), control and monitor the progress in all cores, and then automatically collect and combine the results from all cores. There are several approaches to achieve this in R. 5.4.2.1 Parallel for-loops using socket Likely the most intuitive approach to parallelizing a task in R is the foreach package. It allows you to write a foreach statement that is very similar to the for-loop syntax in R. Hence, you can straightforwardly “translate” an already implemented sequential approach with a common for-loop to a parallel implementation. # COMPUTE REGRESSIONS IN PARALLEL (MULTI-CORE) -------------------------- # packages for parallel processing library(parallel) library(doSNOW) # get the number of cores available ncores &lt;- parallel::detectCores() # set cores for parallel processing ctemp &lt;- makeCluster(ncores) registerDoSNOW(ctemp) # prepare loop N &lt;- 10000 # N &lt;- length(models) for all # run loop in parallel pseudo_Rsq &lt;- foreach ( i = 1:N, .combine = c) %dopar% { # fit the logit model via maximum likelihood fit &lt;- glm(models[[i]], data=marketing, family = binomial()) # compute the proportion of deviance explained by # the independent vars (~R^2) return(1-(fit$deviance/fit$null.deviance)) } # SELECT THE WINNER --------------- models[[which.max(pseudo_Rsq)]] ## [1] &quot;Response ~ Year_Birth+Teenhome+Recency+MntWines+days_customer&quot; With relatively few cases, this approach is not very fast due to the overhead of “distributing” variables/objects from the master process to all cores/workers. In simple terms, the socket approach means that the cores do not share the same variables/the same environment, which creates overhead. However, this approach is usually very stable and runs on all platforms. 5.4.2.2 Parallel lapply using forking Finally, let us look at the implementation based on forking. In the fork approach, each core works with the same objects/variables in a shared environment, which makes this approach very fast. However, depending on what exactly is being computed, sharing an environment can cause problems.22 If you are not sure whether your set up might run into issues with forking, it would be better to rely on a non-fork approach. # COMPUTE REGRESSIONS IN PARALLEL (MULTI-CORE) --------------- # prepare parallel lapply (based on forking, # here clearly faster than foreach) N &lt;- 10000 # N &lt;- length(models) for all # run parallel lapply pseudo_Rsq &lt;- mclapply(1:N, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(i){ # fit the logit model fit &lt;- glm(models[[i]], data=marketing, family = binomial()) # compute the proportion of deviance # explained by the independent vars (~R^2) return(1-(fit$deviance/fit$null.deviance)) }) # SELECT THE WINNER, SHOW FINAL OUTPUT --------------- best_model &lt;- models[[which.max(pseudo_Rsq)]] best_model ## [1] &quot;Response ~ Year_Birth+Teenhome+Recency+MntWines+days_customer&quot; 5.5 GPUs for scientific computing The success of the computer games industry in the late 1990s/early 2000s led to an interesting positive externality for scientific computing. The ever more demanding graphics of modern computer games and the huge economic success of the computer games industry set incentives for hardware producers to invest in research and development of more powerful ‘graphic cards’, extending a normal PC/computing environment with additional computing power solely dedicated to graphics. At the heart of these graphic cards are so-called GPUs (graphic processing units), microprocessors specifically optimized for graphics processing. Figure @refIllustration of a Nvidia GEFORCE RTX 2080 graphics card with a modern graphic processing unit (GPU) (illustration by MarcusBurns1977 under CC BY 3.0 license). depicts a modern graphics card similar to those commonly built into today’s ‘gaming’ PCs. Figure 5.2: Illustration of a Nvidia GEFORCE RTX 2080 graphics card with a modern graphic processing unit (GPU) (illustration by MarcusBurns1977 under CC BY 3.0 license). Why did the hardware industry not simply invest in the development of more powerful CPUs to deal with the more demanding PC games? The main reason is that the architecture of CPUs is designed not only for efficiency but also flexibility. That is, a CPU needs to perform well in all kinds of computations, some parallel, some sequential, etc. Computing graphics is a comparatively narrow domain of computation, and designing a processing unit architecture that is custom-made to excel just at this one task is thus much more cost efficient. Interestingly, this graphics-specific architecture (specialized in highly parallel numerical [floating point] workloads) turns out to also be very useful in some core scientific computing tasks – in particular, matrix multiplications (see Fatahalian, Sugerman, and Hanrahan (2004) for a detailed discussion of why that is the case). A key aspect of GPUs is that they are composed of several multiprocessor units, of which each in turn has several cores. GPUs can thus perform computations with hundreds or even thousands of threads in parallel. Figure @Illustration of a graphic processing unit (GPU). illustrates this point by showing the typical architecture of a NVIDIA GPU. Figure 5.3: Illustration of a graphic processing unit (GPU). While, initially, programming GPUs for scientific computing required a very good understanding of the hardware, graphics card producers have realized that there is an additional market for their products (in particular with the recent rise of deep learning) and now provide several high-level APIs to use GPUs for tasks other than graphics processing. Over the last few years, more high-level software has been developed that makes it much easier to use GPUs in parallel computing tasks. The following subsections show some examples of such software in the R environment.23 5.5.1 GPUs in R 5.5.1.1 GPU computing example: Matrix multiplication comparison (gpuR) The gpuR package provides basic R functions to compute with GPUs from within the R environment. In the following example we compare the performance of a CPU with a GPU based on a matrix multiplication exercise. For a large \\(N\\times P\\) matrix \\(X\\), we want to compute \\(X^tX\\). In a first step, we load the gpuR-package.24 Note the output to the console. It shows the type of GPU identified by gpuR. This is the platform on which gpuR will compute the GPU examples. In order to compare the performances, we also load the bench package. # load package library(bench) library(gpuR) ## Number of platforms: 1 ## - platform: NVIDIA Corporation: OpenCL 3.0 CUDA 11.7.101 ## - context device index: 0 ## - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 ## checked all devices ## completed initialization Next, we initialize a large matrix filled with pseudo-random numbers, representing a dataset with \\(N\\) observations and \\(P\\) variables. # initialize dataset with pseudo-random numbers N &lt;- 10000 # number of observations P &lt;- 100 # number of variables X &lt;- matrix(rnorm(N * P, 0, 1), nrow = N, ncol =P) For the GPU examples to work, we need one more preparatory step. GPUs have their own memory, which they can access faster than they can access RAM. However, this GPU memory is typically not very large compared to the memory CPUs have access to. Hence, there is a potential trade-off between losing some efficiency but working with more data or vice versa.25 Here, we show both variants. With gpuMatrix() we create an object representing matrix X for computation on the GPU. However, this only points the GPU to the matrix and does not actually transfer data to the GPU’s memory. The latter is done in the other variant, with vclMatrix(). # prepare GPU-specific objects/settings # point GPU to matrix (matrix stored in non-GPU memory) gpuX &lt;- gpuMatrix(X, type = &quot;float&quot;) # transfer matrix to GPU (matrix stored in GPU memory) vclX &lt;- vclMatrix(X, type = &quot;float&quot;) Now we run the three examples: first, based on standard R, using the CPU. Then, computing on the GPU but using CPU memory. And finally, computing on the GPU and using GPU memory. In order to make the comparison fair, we force bench::mark() to run at least 20 iterations per benchmarked variant. # compare three approaches (gpu_cpu &lt;- bench::mark( # compute with CPU cpu &lt;- t(X) %*% X, # GPU version, GPU pointer to CPU memory # (gpuMatrix is simply a pointer) gpu1_pointer &lt;- t(gpuX) %*% gpuX, # GPU version, in GPU memory # (vclMatrix formation is a memory transfer) gpu2_memory &lt;- t(vclX) %*% vclX, check = FALSE, memory = FALSE, min_iterations = 20)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 6 ## expression min median ## &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; ## 1 cpu &lt;- t(X) %*% X 74.2ms 75.5ms ## 2 gpu1_pointer &lt;- t(gpuX) %*% gpuX 33.1ms 34.7ms ## 3 gpu2_memory &lt;- t(vclX) %*% vclX 10.7ms 14.8ms ## # … with 3 more variables: `itr/sec` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # mem_alloc &lt;bch:byt&gt;, `gc/sec` &lt;dbl&gt; The performance comparison is visualized with boxplots. plot(gpu_cpu, type = &quot;boxplot&quot;) The theoretically expected pattern becomes clearly visible. When using the GPU + GPU memory, the matrix operation takes on average less than 20 ms, with GPU + RAM over 30 ms, and with the common CPU operation close to 100 ms to finish. In the chapters on applied data analysis, we will look at some applications of GPUs in the domain of deep learning (which relies heavily on matrix multiplications). 5.6 The road ahead: Hardware made for machine learning Due to the high demand for more computational power in the domain of training complex neural network models (for example, in computer vision), Google has recently developed a new hardware platform specifically designed to work with complex neural networks using TensorFlow: Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs were designed from the ground up to improve performance in dense vector and matrix computations with the aim of substantially increasing the speed of training deep learning models implemented with TensorFlow. Figure 5.4: Illustration of a tensor processing unit (TPU). While initially only used internally by Google, the Google Cloud platform now offers cloud TPUs to the general public. 5.7 Wrapping up Be aware of and avoid redundencies in data storage. Consider, for example, storing data in CSV-files instead of JSON-files (if there is no need for storing hierarchical structures). File compression is a more general strategy to avoid redundancies and save mass storage space. It can help you storing even large datasets on disk. However, reading and saving compressed files takes longer, as as additional processing is necessary. As a rule of thumb, store the raw datasets (which don’t have to be accessed that often) in a compressed format. Standard R for data analytics expects the datasets to be imported and available as R objects in the R environment (i.e., in RAM). Hence, the step of importing large datasets to R with the conventional approaches is aimed to parsing and loading the entire dataset into RAM, which might fail if your dataset is larger than the available RAM. Even if a dataset is not too large to fit into RAM, running data analysis scripts on it might then lead to R reaching RAM limits due to the creation of additional R objects in RAM needed for the computation. For example, when running regressions in the conventional way in R, R will generate, among other objects, an object containing the model matrix. However, at this point your original dataset object will still also reside in RAM. Not uncommonly R would then crash or slow down substantially. The reason R might slow down substantially when working with large datasets in RAM is that your computer’s operating system (OS) has a default approach of handling situations with a lack of available RAM: it triggers swapping between the RAM and a dedicated part of the hard disk called virtual memory. In simple terms, your computer starts using parts of the hard disk as an extension of RAM. However, reading/writing from/to the hard disk is much slower than from/to RAM, your entire data analytics script (and any other programs running at the same time) will slow down substantially. Based on the points above, When working locally with a large dataset, recognize why your computer is slowing down or why R is crashing. Consider whether the dataset could theoretically fit into memory. Clarify whether analyzing the already imported data triggers the OS’ virtual memory mechanism. Taken together, your program might run slower than expected due to a lack of RAM (and thus the swapping), and/or due to a very high computational burden on the CPU. For example, bootstrapping the standard errors of regression coefficients. Per default essentially all basic R functions use one CPU thread/core for computation. If RAM is not an issue, setting up repetitive tasks to run in parallel (using more than one CPU thread/core at a time) can substantially speed up your program. Easy-to-use solutions to do this are foreach for a parallel version of for-loops and mclapply for a parallel version of lapply. Finally, if your analytics script builds extensively on matrix multiplication, consider implementing it for processing on your GPU via the gpuR-package. Note though, that this approach presupposes that you have installed and set up your GPU with the right drivers to use it not only for graphics but also for scientific computation. 5.8 Still insufficient computing resources? When working with very large datasets (i.e., terabytes of data), processing the data on one common computer might not work due to a lack of memory or would be way too slow due to a lack of computing power (CPU cores). The architecture or basic hardware set up of a common computer is subject to a limited amount of RAM and a limited number of CPUs/CPU cores. Hence simply scaling up might not be sufficient. Instead we need to scale out. In simple terms, this means connecting several computers (each with their own RAM, CPU, and mass storage) in a network, distributing the dataset across all computers (“nodes”) in this network, and working on the data simultaneously across all nodes. In the next chapter, we look into how such ``distributed systems’’ basically work, what software frameworks are commonly used to work on distributed systems, and how we can interact with this software (and the distributed system) via R and SQL. References "],["distributed-systems.html", "Chapter 6 Distributed Systems 6.1 MapReduce 6.2 Apache Hadoop 6.3 Apache Spark 6.4 Spark with R 6.5 Spark with SQL 6.6 Spark with R + SQL 6.7 Wrapping up", " Chapter 6 Distributed Systems When we connect several computers in a network to jointly process large amounts of data, such a computing system is commonly referred to as a “distributed system”. From a technical standpoint the key difference between a distributed system and the more familiar parallel system (e.g. our desktop computer with its multicore CPU) is that in distributed systems the different components do not share the same memory (and storage). Figure 6.1 illustrates this point. Figure 6.1: Panel A illustrates a distributed system in contrast to the illustration of a parallel system in Panel B. In a distributed system, the data set is literally split up into pieces that then reside separately on different nodes. This requires an additional “layer” of software (that coordinates the distribution/loading of data as well as the simultaneous processing) and different approaches (different “programming models”) to defining computing/data analytics tasks. Below, we will look at both of these aspects in turn. 6.1 MapReduce A broadly used programming model for processing big data on distributed systems is called MapReduce. It essentially consists of two procedures and is conceptually very close to the “split-apply-combine” strategy in data analysis. First, the Map function sorts/filters the data (on each node/computer). Then, a Reduce function aggregates the sorted/filtered data. Thereby, all of these processes are orchestrated to run across many nodes of a cluster computer. Finally, the master node collects the results and returns them to the user. Let us illustrate the basic idea behind MapReduce with a simple example. Suppose you are working on a text mining task in which all the raw text in thousands of digitized books (stored as text files) need to be processed. In a first step, you want to compute word frequencies (count the number of occurrences of specific words in all books combined). For simplicity, let us only focus on the following excerpts from two exemplary (and rather cryptic) books on botany: Text in book 1: Apple Orange Mango   Orange Grapes Plum   Text in book 2: Apple Plum Mango   Apple Apple Plum   Figure @Illustration of the MapReduce programming model. illustrates the MapReduce process. First, the data is loaded from the original text files. Each line of text is then passed to individual mapper instances which separately split the lines of text into key-value pairs. Then the system sorts and shuffles all key-value pairs across all instances and finally. The reducer aggregates the sorted/shuffled key-value pairs (here: counts the number of word occurrences) and, finally, the master instance collects all the results and returns the final output. From this simple example, a key aspect of MapReduce should become clear: for the key tasks of mapping and reducing the data processing on one node/instance can happen completely independent from the processing on the other instances. Note that not for every data analytics task this is so easily conceivable as for computing word frequencies. Figure 6.2: Illustration of the MapReduce programming model. 6.1.1 Aside: MapReduce Concept Illustrated in R In order to better understand the basic concept behind the MapReduce-Framework on a distributed system, let’s look at how we can combine the functions map() and reduce() in R to implement the basic MapReduce example shown above (this is just to illustrate the underlying idea, not to suggest that MapReduce actually is simply an application of the classical map and reduce (fold) functions in functional programming).26 The overall aim of the program is to count the number of times each word is repeated in a given text. The input to the program is thus a text, the output is a list of key-value pairs with the unique words occurring in the text as keys and their respective number of occurrences as values. In the code example, we will use the following text as input. # initiate the input text (for simplicity as one text string) input_text &lt;- &quot;Apple Orange Mango Orange Grapes Plum Apple Plum Mango Apple Apple Plum&quot; 6.1.2 Mapper The Mapper first splits the text into lines, and then splits the lines into key-value pairs, assigning to each key the value 1. For the first step we use strsplit() that takes a character string as input and splits it into a list of sub-strings according to the matches of a sub-string (here \"\\n\", indicating the end of a line). # Mapper splits input into lines lines &lt;- as.list(strsplit(input_text, &quot;\\n&quot;)[[1]]) lines ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;Apple Orange Mango&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;Orange Grapes Plum&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;Apple Plum Mango&quot; ## ## [[4]] ## [1] &quot;Apple Apple Plum&quot; In a second step, we apply our own function (map_fun()) to each line of text via Map(). map_fun() splits each line into words (keys) and assigns a value of 1 to each key. # Mapper splits lines into Key-Value pairs map_fun &lt;- function(x){ # remove special characters x_clean &lt;- gsub(&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, x) # split line into words keys &lt;- unlist(strsplit(x_clean, &quot; &quot;)) # initiate key-value pairs key_values &lt;- rep(1, length(keys)) names(key_values) &lt;- keys return(key_values) } kv_pairs &lt;- Map(map_fun, lines) # look at the result kv_pairs ## [[1]] ## Apple Orange Mango ## 1 1 1 ## ## [[2]] ## Orange Grapes Plum ## 1 1 1 ## ## [[3]] ## Apple Plum Mango ## 1 1 1 ## ## [[4]] ## Apple Apple Plum ## 1 1 1 6.1.3 Reducer The Reducer first sorts and shuffles the input from the Mapper and then reduces the key-value pairs by summing up the values for each key. # order and shuffle kv_pairs &lt;- unlist(kv_pairs) keys &lt;- unique(names(kv_pairs)) keys &lt;- keys[order(keys)] shuffled &lt;- lapply(keys, function(x) kv_pairs[x == names(kv_pairs)]) shuffled ## [[1]] ## Apple Apple Apple Apple ## 1 1 1 1 ## ## [[2]] ## Grapes ## 1 ## ## [[3]] ## Mango Mango ## 1 1 ## ## [[4]] ## Orange Orange ## 1 1 ## ## [[5]] ## Plum Plum Plum ## 1 1 1 Now we can sum up the keys in order to get the word count for the entire input. sums &lt;- lapply(shuffled, Reduce, f=sum) names(sums) &lt;- keys sums ## $Apple ## [1] 4 ## ## $Grapes ## [1] 1 ## ## $Mango ## [1] 2 ## ## $Orange ## [1] 2 ## ## $Plum ## [1] 3 6.2 Apache Hadoop Hadoop Mapreduce is the most broadly known and used implementation of the MapReduce framework. A decade ago big data analytics with really large data sets often involved directly interacting with/ working in Hadoop to run MapReduce jobs. However, over the last few years various higher-level interfaces have been developed that make the usage of MapReduce/Hadoop for data analysts much more easily accessible. The purpose of this section is thus to give a lightweight introduction to the underlying basics that power some of the code examples and tutorials discussed in the data analytics chapters towards the end of this book. 6.2.1 Hadoop word count example To get an idea of how running a Hadoop job looks like, we run the same simple word count example introduced above on a local Hadoop installation. The example presupposes a local installation of Hadoop version 2.10.1 (see Appendix C for details) and can easily be run on a completely normal desktop/laptop computer running Ubuntu Linux. As a side remark, this actually illustrates an important aspect of developing MapReduce scripts in Hadoop (and many of the software packages building on it): the code can be easily developed tested locally on a small machine and only later transferred to the actual Hadoop cluster to be run on the full data set. The basic Hadoop installation comes with a few templates for very typical map/reduce programs.27 Below we replicate the same word-count example as shown in simple R code above. In a first step, we create an input directory where we store the input file(s) to feed to Hadoop. # create directory for input files (typically text files) mkdir ~/input Then we add a text file containing the same text as in the example above. echo &quot;Apple Orange Mango Orange Grapes Plum Apple Plum Mango Apple Apple Plum&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/input/text.txt Now we can run the MapReduce/Hadoop word count as follows, storing the results in a new directory called wordcount_example. This is where we use the already implemented Hadoop script to run a word count job Map/Reduce style. This is where we rely on the already implemented word-count example provided with the Hadoop installation (located in /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.10.1.jar) # run mapreduce word count /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.10.1.jar wordcount ~/input ~/wc_example What this line says is: run the Hadoop program called wordcount implemented in the jar-file hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.10.1.jar, use the files in directory ~/input containing the raw text as input and store the final output in directory ~/wc_example. cat ~/wc_example/* ## Apple 4 ## Grapes 1 ## Mango 2 ## Orange 2 ## Plum 3 What looks rather simple in this example can get very complex once you want to write an entire data analysis script with all kind of analysis for Hadoop. Also, Hadoop was designed for batch processing and does not offer a simple interface for interactive sessions. All of this makes it rather impractical for a usual analytics workflow as we know it from working with R. This is where Apache Spark comes to the rescue. 6.3 Apache Spark Spark is a data analytics engine particularly made for processing large amounts of data on cluster computers. It can partially build on the broader Apache Hadoop framework for handling storage and resource management, but is often faster than Hadoop MapReduce by an order of magnitude. In addition, it offers way more easy-to-use high-level interfaces for typical analytics tasks than Hadoop. In contrast to Hadoop, Spark is specifically made for interactively developing and running data analytics scripts and therefore more easily accessible for people with an applied econometrics background, but no substantial knowledge in MapReduce and/or cluster computing. In particular, it comes with several high-level operators that make it rather easy to implement analytics tasks. As we will see in later chapters, it is very easy to use interactively from within R (and other languages like Python, SQL, and Scala). This makes the platform much more accessible and worth the while for empirical economic research, even for relatively simple econometric analyses. Figure @Basic Spark stack (based on https://spark.apache.org/images/spark-stack.png). illustrates the basic components of Spark. The main functionality, including memory management, task scheduling, and the implementation of Spark’s capabilities to handle and manipulate data distributed across many nodes in parallel. Several built-in libraries extend the core implementation, covering specific domains of practical data analytics tasks (querying structured data via SQL, processing streams of data, machine learning, and network/graph analysis). The latter two provide various common functions/algorithms frequently used in data analytics/applied econometrics, such as generalized linear regression, summary statistics, and principal component analysis. Figure 6.3: Basic Spark stack (based on https://spark.apache.org/images/spark-stack.png). At the heart of big data analytics with Spark is the fundamental data structure called ‘resilient distributed data set’ (RDD). When loading/importing data into Spark, the data is automatically distributed across the cluster in RDDs (~ as distributed collections of elements) and manipulations are then executed in parallel in these RDDs. However, the entire Spark framework also works locally on a simple laptop or desktop computer. This is of great advantage when learning Spark and testing/debugging an analytics script on a small sample of the real data set. 6.4 Spark with R There are two prominent packages to use Spark in connection to R: SparkR and RStudio’s sparklyr, the former is in some ways closer to Spark’s Python API, the latter is closer to the dplyr-type of data handling (and is ‘compatible’ with the ‘tidyverse’).28 For the very simple introductory examples below, either package could have been used equally well. For the general introduction we focus on SparkR and later have a look at a simple regression example based on sparklyr. To install and use Spark from the R shell, only a few preparatory steps are needed. The following examples are based on installing/running Spark on a Linux machine with the SparkR package. SparkR depends on Java (version 8). Thus, we first should make sure the right Java version is installed. If several Java versions are installed, we might have to select version 8 manually via the following terminal command (Linux). With the right version of Java running, we can install SparkR from GitHub (needs the devtools-package) devtools::install_github(\"cran/SparkR\"). After installing SparkR, the call SparkR::install.spark() will download and install Apache Spark to a local directory.29 Now we can start an interactive SparkR session from the terminal with $ SPARK-HOME/bin/sparkR where SPARK-HOME is a placeholder for the path to your local Spark installation (printed to the console after running SparkR::install.spark()). Or simply run SparkR from within RStudio by loading SparkR and initiating Spark with sparkR.session(). # to install use # devtools::install_github(&quot;cran/SparkR&quot;) # load packages library(SparkR) # start session sparkR.session() By default this starts a local standalone session (no connection to a cluster computer needed). While the examples below are all intended to run on a local machine, it is straightforward to connect to a remote Spark cluster and run the same examples there.30 6.4.1 Data import and summary statistics First, we want to have a brief look at how to perform the first few steps of a typical econometric analysis: import data and compute summary statistics. We analyze the already familiar flights.csv data set. The basic Spark installation provides direct support to import common data formats such as CSV and JSON via the read.df() function (for many additional formats, specific Spark libraries are available). To importflights.csv, we set the source-argument to \"csv\". # Import data and create a SparkDataFrame (a distributed collection of data, RDD) flights &lt;- read.df(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, source = &quot;csv&quot;, header=&quot;true&quot;) # inspect the object class(flights) ## [1] &quot;SparkDataFrame&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;SparkR&quot; head(flights) ## year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay ## 1 2013 1 1 517 515 2 ## 2 2013 1 1 533 529 4 ## 3 2013 1 1 542 540 2 ## 4 2013 1 1 544 545 -1 ## 5 2013 1 1 554 600 -6 ## 6 2013 1 1 554 558 -4 ## arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay carrier flight ## 1 830 819 11 UA 1545 ## 2 850 830 20 UA 1714 ## 3 923 850 33 AA 1141 ## 4 1004 1022 -18 B6 725 ## 5 812 837 -25 DL 461 ## 6 740 728 12 UA 1696 ## tailnum origin dest air_time distance hour minute ## 1 N14228 EWR IAH 227 1400 5 15 ## 2 N24211 LGA IAH 227 1416 5 29 ## 3 N619AA JFK MIA 160 1089 5 40 ## 4 N804JB JFK BQN 183 1576 5 45 ## 5 N668DN LGA ATL 116 762 6 0 ## 6 N39463 EWR ORD 150 719 5 58 ## time_hour ## 1 2013-01-01T10:00:00Z ## 2 2013-01-01T10:00:00Z ## 3 2013-01-01T10:00:00Z ## 4 2013-01-01T10:00:00Z ## 5 2013-01-01T11:00:00Z ## 6 2013-01-01T10:00:00Z By default, all variables have been imported as type character. For several variables this is, of course, not the optimal data type to compute summary statistics. We thus first have to convert some columns to other data types with the cast function. flights$dep_delay &lt;- cast(flights$dep_delay, &quot;double&quot;) flights$dep_time &lt;- cast(flights$dep_time, &quot;double&quot;) flights$arr_time &lt;- cast(flights$arr_time, &quot;double&quot;) flights$arr_delay &lt;- cast(flights$arr_delay, &quot;double&quot;) flights$air_time &lt;- cast(flights$air_time, &quot;double&quot;) flights$distance &lt;- cast(flights$distance, &quot;double&quot;) Suppose we only want to compute average arrival delays per carrier for flights with a distance over 1000 miles. Variable selection and filtering of observations is implemented in select() and filter() (as in the dplyr package). # filter long_flights &lt;- select(flights, &quot;carrier&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;arr_delay&quot;, &quot;distance&quot;) long_flights &lt;- filter(long_flights, long_flights$distance &gt;= 1000) head(long_flights) ## carrier year arr_delay distance ## 1 UA 2013 11 1400 ## 2 UA 2013 20 1416 ## 3 AA 2013 33 1089 ## 4 B6 2013 -18 1576 ## 5 B6 2013 19 1065 ## 6 B6 2013 -2 1028 Now we summarize the arrival delays for the subset of long flights by carrier. This is the ‘split-apply-combine’ approach applied in SparkR. # aggregation: mean delay per carrier long_flights_delays&lt;- summarize(groupBy(long_flights, long_flights$carrier), avg_delay = mean(long_flights$arr_delay)) head(long_flights_delays) ## carrier avg_delay ## 1 UA 3.2622 ## 2 AA 0.4958 ## 3 EV 15.6876 ## 4 B6 9.0364 ## 5 DL -0.2394 ## 6 OO -2.0000 Finally, we want to convert the result back into a usual data.frame (loaded in our current R session) in order to further process the summary statistics (output to LaTex table, plot, etc.). Note that as in the previous aggregation exercises with the ff package, the computed summary statistics (in the form of a table/df) are obviously much smaller than the raw data. However, note that converting a SparkDataFrame back into a native R object generally means all the data stored in the RDDs constituting the SparkDataFrame object are loaded into local RAM. Hence, when working with actual big data on a Spark cluster, this type of operation can quickly overflow local RAM. # Convert result back into native R object delays &lt;- collect(long_flights_delays) class(delays) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; delays ## carrier avg_delay ## 1 UA 3.2622 ## 2 AA 0.4958 ## 3 EV 15.6876 ## 4 B6 9.0364 ## 5 DL -0.2394 ## 6 OO -2.0000 ## 7 F9 21.9207 ## 8 US 0.5567 ## 9 MQ 8.2331 ## 10 HA -6.9152 ## 11 AS -9.9309 ## 12 VX 1.7645 ## 13 WN 9.0842 ## 14 9E 6.6730 6.5 Spark with SQL Instead of interacting with Spark via R, you can do the same via SQL. This can be very convenient at the stage of data exploration and data preparation. Also note that this is a very good example of how knowing some SQL can be very useful when working with Big Data even if you are not interacting with an actual relational database.31 To directly interact with Spark via SQL, open a terminal window, switch to the SPARK-HOME directory, cd SPARK-HOME and enter the following command, $ bin/spark-sql where SPARK-HOME is again the placeholder for the path to your local Spark installation (printed to the console after running SparkR::install.spark()). This will start up Spark and connect to it via Spark’s SQL interface. You will notice that the prompt in the terminal changes (similar to when you start sqlite). Let’s run some example queries. The Spark installation comes with several data and script examples. The example data sets are located at SPARK-HOME/examples/src/main/resources. For example, the file employees.json contains the following records in JSON format: {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;:3000} {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Andy&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;:4500} {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Justin&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;:3500} {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Berta&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;:4000} We can query this data directly via SQL commands by referring to the location of the original JSON file. Select all observations SELECT * FROM json.`examples/src/main/resources/employees.json` ; Michael 3000 Andy 4500 Justin 3500 Berta 4000 Time taken: 0.099 seconds, Fetched 4 row(s) Filter observations SELECT * FROM json.`examples/src/main/resources/employees.json` WHERE salary &lt;4000 ; Michael 3000 Justin 3500 Time taken: 0.125 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s) Compute the average salary SELECT AVG(salary) AS mean_salary FROM json.`examples/src/main/resources/employees.json` ; 3750.0 Time taken: 0.142 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s) 6.6 Spark with R + SQL Most conveniently, you can combine the SQL query features of Spark and SQL with running R on Spark. First, initiate the Spark session in RStudio and import the data as Spark data frame. # to install use # devtools::install_github(&quot;cran/SparkR&quot;) # load packages library(SparkR) # start session sparkR.session() ## Java ref type org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession id 1 # read data flights &lt;- read.df(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, source = &quot;csv&quot;, header=&quot;true&quot;) Now we can make the Spark data frame accessible for SQL queries by registering it as a temporary table/view with createOrReplaceTempView() and then run SQL queries on it from within the R session via the sql()-function. sql() will return the results as Spark data frame (this means the result is also located on the cluster and does hardly affect the master node’s memory). # register the data frame as a table createOrReplaceTempView(flights, &quot;flights&quot; ) # now run SQL queries on it query &lt;- &quot;SELECT DISTINCT carrier, year, arr_delay, distance FROM flights WHERE 1000 &lt;= distance&quot; long_flights2 &lt;- sql(query) head(long_flights2) ## carrier year arr_delay distance ## 1 DL 2013 -30 1089 ## 2 UA 2013 -11 1605 ## 3 DL 2013 -42 1598 ## 4 UA 2013 -5 1585 ## 5 AA 2013 6 1389 ## 6 UA 2013 -23 1620 6.7 Wrapping up At the core of a vertical scaling strategy are so-called distributed systems, computers connected in a network several to jointly process large amounts of data. In contrast to standard parallel-computing, the different computing nodes in a distributed system do not share the same physical memory. Each of the nodes/computers in the system has its own CPU, hard disk, and RAM. This architecture requires another computing paradigm to run the same data analytics job across all nodes (in parallel). A commonly use paradigm to do this is MapReduce, which is implemented in the software called Apache Hadoop. The core idea of MapReduce is to split a problem/computing task on a large dataset into several components, each of which focusing on a smaller subset of the dataset. The task components are then distributed across the cluster, so that one component is handled by one computer in the network. Finally, each node returns its result to the master node (the computer coordinating all activities in the cluster), where the partial results are combined into the overall result. A typical example of a MapReduce job is the computation of term frequencies in a large body of text. Here, each node computes the number of occurrences of specific words in a subset of the overall body of text, the individual results are then summed up per unique word. Apache Hadoop is a collection of open source software tools to work with massive amounts of data on a distributed system (a network of computers). Part of Hadoop is the Hadoop MapReduce implementation to run MapReduce jobs on a Hadoop cluster. Apache Spark is an analytics engine for large-scale data processing on local machines or clusters. It improves upon several shortcomings of the previous Hadoop/MapReduce framework, in particular with regard to iterative tasks (such as in machine learning). For a more detailed discussion of what map and reduce have actually to do with MapReduce see this post.↩︎ More sophisticated programs need to be custom made, written in Java.↩︎ See this blog post for a more detailed comparison and discussion of advantages of either package.↩︎ Note that after the installation, the location of Spark is printed to the R console. Alternatively, you can also first install the sparklyr-package and then run sparklyr::spark_install() to install Spark. In the data analysis examples later in the book we will work both with SparkR and sparklyr.↩︎ Simply set the master argument of sparkR.session() to the URL of the Spark master node of the remote cluster. Importantly, the local Spark and Hadoop versions should match the corresponding versions on the remote cluster.↩︎ Importantly, this also means that we cannot use SQL commands related to configuring such databases such as .tables etc. Instead we use SQL commands to directly query data from JSON or CSV files.↩︎ "],["cloud-computing.html", "Chapter 7 Cloud Computing 7.1 Cloud computing basics and platforms 7.2 Transitioning to the cloud 7.3 Scaling up in the cloud: virtual servers 7.4 Scaling up with GPUs 7.5 Scaling out: MapReduce in the cloud 7.6 Wrapping up", " Chapter 7 Cloud Computing In this chapter, we first look at what cloud computing basically is and what platforms provide cloud computing services. We then focus on scaling up in the cloud. For the sake of simplicity, we will primarily focus on how to use cloud instances provided by one of the providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, once you are familiar with setting things up on AWS, also using Google Cloud, Azure, etc. will be easy. Most of the core services are provided by all providers and once you understand the basics the different dashboards will look quite familiar. In a second step, we look at a prominent approach to scaling out by setting up a Spark cluster in the cloud. 7.1 Cloud computing basics and platforms So far we have focused on the available computing resources on our local machines (desktop/laptop) and how to use them optimally when dealing with large amounts of data and/or computationally demanding tasks. A key aspect of this has been to understand why our local machine is struggling with a computing task when there is a large amount of data to be processed and then identify potential avenues to use the available resources more efficiently. For example, by using one of the following approaches: Computationally intense tasks (but not pushing RAM to the limit): parallelization, using several CPU cores (nodes) in parallel. Memory-intense tasks (data still fits into RAM): efficient memory allocation. Memory-intense tasks (data does not fit into RAM): efficient use of virtual memory (use parts of mass storage device as virtual memory). Storage: efficient storage (avoid redundancies). In practice, data sets might be too large for our local machine even if we take all of the techniques listed above into account. That is, a parallelized task might still take ages to complete because our local machine has too few cores available, a task involving virtual memory would use up way too much space on our hard-disk, etc. In such situations, we have to think about horizontal and vertical scaling beyond our local machine. That is, we outsource tasks to a bigger machine (or a cluster of machines) to which our local computer is connected (typically, over the Internet). While only one or two decades ago most organizations had their own large centrally hosted machines (database servers, cluster computers) for such tasks, today they often rely on third-party solutions ‘in the cloud’. That is, specialized companies provide computing resources (usually, virtual servers) that can be easily accessed via a broadband Internet-connection and rented on an hourly (or even minutes or seconds) basis. Given the obvious economies of scale in this line of business, a few large players have emerged who practically dominate most of the global market: Amazon Web Services (AWS). Microsoft Azure Google Cloud Platform (GCP) IBM Cloud Alibaba Cloud Tencent Cloud and others. In the following subsections and chapters we will primarily rely on services provided by AWS and GCP. In order to try out the code examples and tutorials, make sure to have a AWS account as well as a Google account (which can then easily be linked to GCP). For the AWS account go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and create an account. You will have to enter credit card details for either cloud platform when setting up/linking accounts. Importantly, you will only be charged for the time you use an AWS service. However, even when using some cloud instances, several of AWS’ cloud products offer a free tier to test and try out products. The following examples rely whenever possible on free-tier instances, otherwise it is explicitly indicated that running the example in the cloud will generate some costs on your account. For the GCP account, have your Google login credentials ready and visit https://cloud.google.com/ to register your Google account with GCP. Again, credit card details are needed to set up an account but many of the services can be used for free to a certain extend (to learn and try out code). 7.2 Transitioning to the cloud When login into AWS and GCP, you will notice the breadth of services offered by these platforms. There are even more than ten main categories of services, with many subcategories and products in each. It is easy to get lost from just browsing through it. Rest assured that for the purpose of data analytics/applied econometrics, many of these services are irrelevant. Our motivation to use the cloud is to extend our computational resources in order use our analytics scripts on large data sets, not to develop and deploy web applications or business analytics dashboards. With this perspective, a small selection of services will make the cloud easily accessible for daily analytics workflows. When we use services from AWS or GCP to scale up (vertical scaling) the available resources, the transition from our local implementation of a data analytics task to the cloud implementation is often rather simple. Once we have set up a cloud instance and figured out how to communicate with it, we typically can run the exact same R-script locally and in the cloud. This is usually the case for parallelized tasks (simply run the same script on a machine with more cores), in-memory tasks (rent a machine with more RAM but still use data.table() etc.), as well as highly parallelized tasks to be run on GPUs. The transition from a local implementation to horizontal scaling (scaling out) in the cloud will rely slightly more preparatory steps. However, in this domain we will directly build on 7.3 Scaling up in the cloud: virtual servers 7.3.1 Scaling up with AWS EC2 and R/RStudio One of the easiest ways to set up an AWS EC2 instance for R/RStudio is to use Louis Aslett’s Amazon Machine Image (AMI). This way you do not need to install R/Rstudio yourself. Simply follow these five steps: Depending on the region in which you want to initiate your EC2 instance, click on the corresponding AMI link in https://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/. For example, if you want to initiate the instance in Frankfurt click on ami-076abd591c4335092. You will be automatically directed to the AWS page where you can select the type of EC2 instance you want to initiate. Per default the free tier T2.micro instance is selected (I recommend using this type of instance, if you simply want to try out the examples below). After selecting the instance type, click on “Review and Launch”. On the opened page, select “Edit security groups”. There should be one entry with SSH selected in the drop-down menu. Click on this drop-down menu and select HTTP (instead of SSH). Click again on “Review and Launch” to confirm the change. Then, click “Launch” to initiate the instance. From the pop-up concerning the key pair, select “Proceed without a key pair” from the drop-down menu and check the box below (“I acknowledge …”). Click “Launch” to confirm. A page opens. Click on “View” instances to see all of your instances and their status. Wait until “Status check” is “2/2 checks passed” (you might want to refresh the instance overview or browser window). Click on the instance ID of your newly launched instance and copy the public IPv4 address, open a new browser window/tab, type in http://, paste the IP address, and hit enter (the address in your browser bar will be something like http://3.66.120.150; http, not https!) . You should see the login-interface to RStudio on your cloud instance. The username is rstudio and the password is the instance ID of your newly launched instance (it might take a while to load R/Rstudio). Once RStudio is loaded, you are ready to go. NOTE: the instructions above help you set up your own EC2 instance with R/RStudio to run some example scripts and tryout R on EC2. For more serious/professional (long-term) usage of an EC2 instance, I strongly recommend to set it up manually and improve the security settings accordingly! The above set up will theoretically result in your instance being accessible for anyone in the Web (something you might want to avoid). 7.3.2 Parallelization with an EC2 instance This short tutorial illustrates how to scale the computation up by running it on an AWS EC2 instance. Thereby, we build on the techniques discussed in the previous chapter. Note that our EC2 instance is a Linux machine. When running R on a Linux machine, there is sometimes an additional step to install R packages (at least for most of the packages): R packages need to be compiled before they can be installed. The command to install packages is exactly the same (install.packages()) and normally you only notice a slight difference in the output shown in the R console during installation (and the installation process takes a little longer than what you are used to). In some cases you might also have to install additional dependencies directly in Linux. Apart from that, using R via RStudio Server in the cloud looks/feels very similar if not identical as when using R/RStudio locally. 7.3.2.1 Preparatory steps If your EC2 instance with RStudio-Server is not running yet, do the following. In the AWS console, navigate to EC2, select your EC2 instance (with RStudio Server installed) , and click on “Instance state/Start instance”. You will have to wait until you see “2/2 checks passed”. Then, open a new browser window, enter the address of your EC2/RStudio-Server instance (see above, e.g. http://3.66.120.150), and log in to RStudio. First, we need to install the parallel and doSNOW packages. In addition we will rely on the stringr package. # install packages for parallelization install.packages(&quot;parallel&quot;, &quot;doSNOW&quot;, &quot;stringr&quot;) Once the installations have finished, you can load the packages and verify the number of cores available on your EC2 instance as follows. In case you have chosen the free tier T2.micro instance type when setting up your EC2 instance, you will see that you only have one core available. Do not worry. It is reasonable practice to test your parallelization script with a few iterations on a small machine before bringing out the big guns. The specialized packages we use for parallelization here do not mind if you have one or 32 cores, the same code runs on either machine (obviously not very fast with only one core). # load packages library(parallel) library(doSNOW) # verify no. of cores available n_cores &lt;- detectCores() n_cores Finally, we have to upload the data that we want to process as part of the parallelization task. To this end, in RStudio-Server, navigate to the file explorer in the lower-right corner. The graphical user interface of a local RStudio installation and RStudio-Server is almost identical. However, you will find in the file explorer pane a “Upload”-button to transfer files from your local machine to the EC2 instance. In this demonstration, we will work with the previously introduced marketing_data.csv dataset. You can thus click on “Upload” and upload it to the current target directory (the home directory of RStudio-Server). As soon as the file is uploaded you can work with it as usual (as on the local RStudio installation). To keep things like in the local examples, use the file explorer to create a new data folder and move marketing_data.csv in this new folder. The screenshot in Figure @File explorer and Upload-button on Rstudio-Server. shows a screenshot of the corresponding section. Figure 7.1: File explorer and Upload-button on Rstudio-Server. In order to test if all is set up properly to run a in parallel on our EC2 instance, open a new R-script in RStudio-Server and copy/paste the preparatory steps and the simple parallelization example from Section 4.5 into the R-Script. # PREPARATION ----------------------------- # packages library(stringr) # import data marketing &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/marketing_data.csv&quot;) # clean/prepare data marketing$Income &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, marketing$Income)) marketing$days_customer &lt;- as.Date(Sys.Date())- as.Date(marketing$Dt_Customer, &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;) marketing$Dt_Customer &lt;- NULL # all sets of independent vars indep &lt;- names(marketing)[ c(2:19, 27,28)] combinations_list &lt;- lapply(1:length(indep), function(x) combn(indep, x, simplify = FALSE)) combinations_list &lt;- unlist(combinations_list, recursive = FALSE) models &lt;- lapply(combinations_list, function(x) paste(&quot;Response ~&quot;, paste(x, collapse=&quot;+&quot;))) 7.3.2.2 Test parallelized code Now, we can start testing the code on EC2 without registering the one core for cluster processing. This way %dopart% will automatically resort to running the code sequentially. Make sure to set N to 10 (or another small number) for this test. # set cores for parallel processing # ctemp &lt;- makeCluster(ncores) # registerDoSNOW(ctemp) # prepare loop N &lt;- 10 # just for illustration, the actual code is N &lt;- length(models) # run loop in parallel pseudo_Rsq &lt;- foreach ( i = 1:N, .combine = c) %dopar% { # fit the logit model via maximum likelihood fit &lt;- glm(models[[i]], data=marketing, family = binomial()) # compute the proportion of deviance explained by the independent vars (~R^2) return(1-(fit$deviance/fit$null.deviance)) } Once the test has run through successfully, we are ready to scale up and run the actual workload in parallel in the cloud. 7.3.2.3 Scale up and run in parallel First, switch back to the AWS EC2 console and stop the instance by selecting the tick-mark in the corresponding row, and click on “Instance state/stop instance”. Once the Instance state is “Stopped”, click on “Actions/Instance settings/change instance type”. You will be presented with a drop-down menu from which you can select the new instance type and confirm. The example bellow is based on selecting the t2.2xlarge (with 8 vCPUs and 32MB of RAM). Now you can start the instance again, log in to RStudio-Server (as above) and run the script again but this time with the following lines not commented out (in order to make use of all eight cores). # set cores for parallel processing ctemp &lt;- makeCluster(ncores) registerDoSNOW(ctemp) In order to monitor the usage of computing resources on your instance, switch to the Terminal tab, type in htop, and hit enter. This will open the interactive process viewer called htop. Figure @Monitor resources and processes with htop. shows the output of htop preparatory phase of the parallel task implemented above. The output confirms the available resources provided by a t2.2xlarge EC2 instance (with 8 vCPUs and 32MB of RAM). When using the default free tier T2.micro instance, you will notice in the htop output that only one core is available. Figure 7.2: Monitor resources and processes with htop. 7.4 Scaling up with GPUs As discussed in chapter 4, GPUs can help speed up highly parallelizable tasks such as matrix multiplications. While using a local GPU/Graphics card for statistical analysis has become easier due to more easily accessible software layers around the GPUs, it still needs solid knowledge regarding the installation of specific GPU drivers and changing of basic system settings. Many users specializing on the data analytics side rather the computer science/hardware side of big data analytics might not be comfortable with making such installations/changes on their desktop computers or might not have the right type of GPU/graphics card in their device for such changes. In addition, for many users it might not make sense to have a powerful GPU in their local machine, if they only occasionally use it for certain machine learning or parallel computing tasks. In recent years, many cloud computing platforms started providing virtual machines with access to GPUs, in many cases with additional layers of software and/or pre-installed drivers, allowing users to directly run their code on GPUs in the cloud. Below, we briefly look at two of the most easy-to-use options to run code on GPUs in the cloud: using Google Colab notebooks with GPUs, and setting up RStudio on virtual machines in a special EC2 tier with GPU access on AWS. 7.4.1 GPUs on Google Colab Google Colab provides a very easy way to run R code on GPUs from Google Cloud. All you need is a Google account. Open a new browser window, go to https://colab.to/r and log in with your Google account if prompted to do so. Colab will open a Jupyter notebook with an R runtime. Click on “Runtime/Change runtime type” and select in the drop-down menu under ‘Hardware accelerator’ the option ‘GPU’. Figure 7.3: Colab notebook with R runtime and GPUs. Then, you can install the packages you need to work with GPU acceleration (e.g., gpuR, keras and tensorflow) and the code relying on GPU processing will be run on GPUs (or even TPUs). Under the following link you find a Colab-notebook set up for running a simply image classification tutorial with keras on TPUs: bit.ly/bda_colab. 7.4.2 RStudio and EC2 with GPUs on AWS To start a ready-made EC2 instance with GPUs and RStudio installed, open a browser window and navigate to this service provided by RStudio on the AWS Marketplace: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0785SXYB2. Click on Subscribe. Figure 7.4: AWS Marketplace product provided by RStudio to run RStudio Server with Tensorflow-GPU on AWS EC2. Then, click on Continue to Configuration and Continue to Launch. If you want to use the smallest/cheapest EC2 instance, select under “EC2 Instance Type” g3s.xlarge. If necessary, create a new key pair under Key Pair Settings, otherwise keep all the default settings as they are. Then, at the bottom, click on Launch. This will launch a new EC2 instance with a GPU and with RStudio server installed.32 Figure 7.5: Launch RStudio Server with Tensorflow-GPU on AWS EC2. Once the instance is launched go to the EC2 dashboard, click on the new instance, copy its public DNS, open a new browser window and go to http://&lt;ec2_instance_public_dns&gt;:8787. You should see the RStudio server login. You can log in with username rstudio-user and the instance_id of your newly created instance as the password.33 7.5 Scaling out: MapReduce in the cloud Many cloud computing providers offer specialized services for MapReduce tasks in the cloud. Here we look at a comparatively easy-to-use solution provided by AWS, called Elastic MapReduce (AWS EMR). It allows to set up a Hadoop cluster in the cloud within minutes and requires essentially no additional configuration if the cluster is being used for the kind of data analytics tasks discussed in this book. Setting up a default AWS EMR cluster via the AWS console is straightforward. Simply go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/, click on “Create cluster” and adjust the default selection of settings if necessary. Alternatively, we can set up an EMR cluster via the AWS command-line interface (CLI). In the following tutorials, we will work with AWS EMR via R/Rstudio (specifically, via the package sparklyr). Per default, RStudio is not part of the EMR cluster set up. However, AWS EMR offers a very flexible way to install/configure additional software on virtual EMR clusters via so-called “bootstrap” scripts. These scripts can be shared on AWS S3 and used by others, which is what we do in the following cluster set up via the CLI.34 In order to run the cluster set up via AWS CLI shown below, you need an SSH key to later connect to the EMR cluster. If you do not have such an SSH key for AWS yet, follow these instructions to generate one: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/classic/userguide/generate_ssh_key.html. In the example below, the key generated in this way is stored in a file called sparklyr.pem.35 The following command (aws emr create-cluster) initiates our EMR cluster with a specific set of options (all of these options can also be modified via the AWS console in the browser). --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark Name=Hive Name=Pig Name=Tez Name=Ganglia specifies which type of basic applications (that are essential to running different types of MapReduce tasks) should be installed on the cluster. Unless you really know what you are doing, do not change that setting. --name \"EMR 6.1 RStudio + sparklyr simply specifies how the newly initiated cluster should be called (this name will then appear on your list of clusters in the AWS console). More relevant for what follows is the line specifying what type of virtual servers (EC2 instances) should be used as part of the cluster: --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge specifies that the one master node (the machine distributing tasks and coordinating the MapReduce procedure) is an instance of type m3.2xlarge; InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge specifies that there are two slave nodes in this cluster, also of type m1.medium.36 --bootstrap-action Path=s3://aws-bigdata-blog/artifacts/aws-blog-emr-rstudio-sparklyr/rstudio_sparklyr_emr6.sh,Name=\"Install RStudio\" tells the set-up application to run the corresponding bootstrap script on the cluster in order to install the additional software (here RStudio). Finally, there are two important aspects to note: First, in order to initiate the cluster in this way, you need to have an SSH key pair (for your EC2 instances) set up, which you then instruct the cluster to use with KeyName=. That is, KeyName=\"sparklyr\" means that the user already has create an SSH key pair called sparklyr and that this is the key pair that will be used with the cluster nodes for SSH connections. Second, the --region argument defines in which AWS region the cluster should be created. Importantly, in this particular case, the bootstrap script used to install RStudio on the cluster is stored in the us-east-1 region, hence we need to set up the cluster also in this region --region us-east-1 (otherwise the set up will fail as the set-up application will not find the bootstrap script and terminate with an error!). aws emr create-cluster \\ --release-label emr-6.1.0 \\ --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark Name=Hive Name=Pig Name=Tez Name=Ganglia \\ --name &quot;EMR 6.1 RStudio + sparklyr&quot; \\ --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \\ --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge \\ InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge \\ --bootstrap-action Path=&#39;s3://aws-bigdata-blog/artifacts/aws-blog-emr-rstudio-sparklyr/rstudio_sparklyr_emr6.sh&#39;,Name=&quot;Install RStudio&quot; --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole,KeyName=&quot;sparklyr&quot; \\ --configurations &#39;[{&quot;Classification&quot;:&quot;spark&quot;,&quot;Properties&quot;:{&quot;maximizeResourceAllocation&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}}]&#39; \\ --region us-east-1 Setting up this cluster with all the additional software and configurations from the bootstrap script will take around 40 minutes. You can always follow the progress in the AWS console. Once the cluster is ready, you will see something like this: Figure 7.6: AWS EMR console indicating the successful set up of the EMR cluster In order to access RStudio on the EMR cluster’s master node via a secure SSH connection, follow these steps: First, follow the prerequisites to connect to EMR via SSH: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-ssh-prereqs.html. Then initiate the SSH tunnel to the EMR cluster as instructed here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-ssh-tunnel.html. Protect your key-file (sparklyr.pem) by navigating to the location of the key-file on your computer in the terminal and run chmod 600 sparklyr.pem before connecting. Also make sure your IP address is still the one you have entered in the previous step (you can check your current IP address by visiting https://whatismyipaddress.com/). In a browser tab, navigate to the AWS EMR console, click on the newly created cluster and copy the “Master public DNS”. In the terminal, connect to the EMR cluster via SSH by running ssh -i sparklyr.pem -ND 8157 hadoop@master-node-dns (if you have protected the key-file as super user, i.e. sudo chmod, you will need to use sudo ssh here; make sure to replace master-node-dns with the actual dns copied from the AWS EMR console). The terminal will be busy but you won’t see any output (if all goes well). In your Firefox browser, install the FoxyProxy add on. Follow these instructions to set up the proxy via FoxyProxy: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-proxy.html. Select the newly created Socks5 proxy in FoxyProxy. Go to http://localhost:8787/ and enter with username hadoop and password hadoop. Now you can run sparklyr on the AWS EMR cluster. After finishing working with the cluster, make sure to terminate it via the EMR console. This will shot down all the EC2 instances that are part of the cluster (and hence AWS will stop charging you for this). Once you have connected and logged in to RStudio on the EMR cluster’s master node, you can connect the the Rstudio session to the Spark cluster as follows. ## ## Attaching package: &#39;sparklyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## collect, distinct, filter, mutate, select ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter # load packages library(sparklyr) # connect rstudio session to cluster sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = &quot;yarn&quot;) After using the EMR Spark cluster, make sure to terminate the cluster in the AWS EMR console to avoid additional charges. This automatically terminates all the EC2 machines linked to the cluster. 7.6 Wrapping up Cloud computing refers to the on-demand availability of computing resources. While many of today’s cloud computing services go beyond the scope of the common data analytics tasks discussed in this book, a handful of specific services can be very efficient in providing you with the right solution if the local computing resources are not sufficient, as summarized in the following bullet points. EC2 (elastic cloud computing): scale your analysis up with a virtual server/virtual machine in the cloud. For example, rent an EC2 instance for couple of minutes in order to run a massive parallel task on 36 cores. GPUs in the cloud: Google Colab offers an easy-to-use interface to run your machine-learning code on GPUs, for example, in the context of training neural nets. AWS RDS offers a straightforward way to set up an SQL database in the cloud without any need for database server installation and maintenance. - AWS EMR allows you to flexibly set up and run your Spark/sparkly or Hadoop code on a cluster of EC2 machines in the cloud. Note that you might not have the required vCPU limit to additionally launch such an instance. In that case you will get an error message You have requested more vCPU capacity than your current vCPU limit of 0 allows for the instance bucket that the specified instance type belongs to. Please visit http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request to request an adjustment to this limit.. Simply follow the indicated URL and send your request to increase the capacity. After your limit is adjusted, click again on Launch as per the procedure outlined above.↩︎ It is strongly recommended to change the password afterwards. In order to do that, click on “Tools” and select “shell”. Then type “password” into the shell/terminal and enter the current password (the instance id) and then enter the new password, hit enter, and enter again the new password to confirm.↩︎ Specifically, we will use the bootstrap script provided by the AWS Big Data Blog, which is stored here: s3://aws-bigdata-blog/artifacts/aws-blog-emr-rstudio-sparklyr/rstudio_sparklyr_emr6.sh↩︎ If you simply copy-paste the CLI command below to set up an EMR cluster, make sure to name your key file also sparklyr.pem.

For an actual↩︎ "],["introduction-to-part-ii.html", "Introduction to Part II 7.7 Aside: ETL vs. ELT", " Introduction to Part II In this part we combine the conceptual basics of part I with the platform basics in part II and look at each practical step involved in analyzing big data in the context of applied econometrics/business analytics. Thereby, the focus is primarily on how to handle big data in order to gather, prepare, combine, filter, visualize, and summarize it for analytics purposes. That is, we cover all core practical tasks necessary before running more sophisticated econometric analyses or machine learning algorithms on the data. Each of these core tasks is summarized in a separate chapter, whereby the sequence of chapters follows a typical workflow/process in applied data science, usually referred to as data pipeline. The data pipeline concept is useful to illustrate and organize the process from gathering/extracting the raw data from various data sources to the final analytics output. The concept of data pipelines thus helps us to structure all steps involved in a meaningful way. Figure (ref:datapipeline?) illustrates the data pipeline idea, which is consistent with the order and content of how the chapters in this book cover all the tasks involved in the first steps of a big data analytics project. Initial, intermediate, and final data entities are displayed as nodes in the flow diagram and tasks/activities between these entities are displayed as arrows. Figure 7.7: Illustration of a generic data pipeline in a data analytics project. In many domains of modern data science, data pipelines also involve loops, indicating that certain parts of the overall process are iterative and repeated several times in order to further optimize and maintain the final data product. Such a perspective is typical in a context where the final data product is a dashboard or a (component of a) web application which is at some point deployed and runs in production. For the perspective of this book, we intentionally follow an acyclical concept of the data pipeline, representative for data projects in business analytics and applied economic research, in which raw data needs to be collected, processed, and analyzed with the aim of delivering statistical insights summarized in a report or presentation. In that sense, each chapter in this part builds on the previous one and I recommend going through these chapters sequentially. Note though that in your work it might make sense to slightly re-arrange some parts of the workflow suggested by the generic data pipeline suggested here. In particular, you might want to first systematically collect and store all of the needed data and then only selectively load and transform/clean parts of this data for analysis (an approach usually referred to as Extract-Load-Transform (ELT)), or, in contrast, you might want to directly clean all the gathered data and store all of the cleaned/prepared data in a cleanly structured database before turning to any analytics steps (as the pipeline illustration above would suggest, and what is typically referred to as Extract-Load-Transform (ELT)). 7.7 Aside: ETL vs. ELT In traditional business analytics, a company’s raw/unstructured data was typically handled and prepared by IT specialists and then provided in a final clean/transformed analytic dataset to the data analysts. Such a process can generally be described as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL). In ETL the data analyst is only presented with the final well-structured database containing all variables and observations (e.g., in a traditional SQL database). The data pipeline illustration above basically follows the ETL idea in the sense that raw data is gathered/extracted, then cleaned, and then stored in a structured format before it is queried and analyzed. With large amounts of data from various sources with frequent updating (as is typical for big data), this process is rather slow and might be inefficient in the sense that parts of the raw data might in the end not play an important role in the data analytics project. Nowadays, with data analysts and data scientists being increasingly familiar with data technologies and how to handle raw/unstructured data, a more flexible process called Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) is followed. In ELT, raw data is extracted and then ingested into/stored in more flexible frameworks than traditional SQL databases that do not require the data to be perfectly structured/cleaned, such as data warehouses and data lakes. The transformation of the data for analytics purposes is then done on demand and practically does often involve the same person later analyzing the data. Importantly, for the perspective on data analytics in this book, either process involves in one way or the other the components illustrated in the pipeline above. However, the order of the individual steps varies between ETL and ELT. "],["data-collection-and-data-storage.html", "Chapter 8 Data Collection and Data Storage 8.1 Gathering and compilation of raw data 8.2 Stack/combine raw source files 8.3 Aside: CSV import and memory allocation 8.4 Efficient local data storage 8.5 Connecting R to RDBMS 8.6 Cloud solutions for (big) data storage 8.7 Column-based analytics databases 8.8 Data warehouses 8.9 Data lakes and simple storage service 8.10 Wrapping up", " Chapter 8 Data Collection and Data Storage The first steps of a data analytics project typically deal with the question of how to collect, organize, and store the raw data for further processing. In this chaper, we cover several approaches of how to practically implement these steps in the context of observational data, as they commonly occur in applied econometrics and business analytics. Thereby, the focus lies on several important aspects of how to implement these steps locally, and then introduces several useful cloud tools to store and query large amounts of data for analytics purposes. 8.1 Gathering and compilation of raw data The NYC Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) provides detailed data on all trip records including pick-up and drop-off times/locations. When combining all available trip records from 2009 to 2018, we get a rather large data set of over 200GB. The code examples below illustrate how to collect and compile the entire data set. In order to avoid long computing times, the code examples shown below are based on a small sub-set of the actual raw data (however, all examples involving virtual memory, are in theory scalable to the extent of the entire raw data set). The raw data consists of several monthly Parquet-files and can be downloaded via the TLC’s website. The following short R-script automates the downloading of all available trip-record files. NOTE: Downloading all files can take several hours and will occupy over 200GB! ################################# # Fetch all TLC trip recrods # Data source: # https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page # Input: Monthly parquet files from urls ################################# # SET UP ----------------- # packages library(R.utils) # to create directories from within R # fix vars BASE_URL &lt;- &quot;https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2018-01.parquet&quot; OUTPUT_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/tlc_trips/&quot; START_DATE &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2009-01-01&quot;) END_DATE &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2018-06-01&quot;) # BUILD URLS ----------- # parse base url base_url &lt;- gsub(&quot;2018-01.parquet&quot;, &quot;&quot;, BASE_URL) # build urls dates &lt;- seq(from= START_DATE, to = END_DATE, by = &quot;month&quot;) year_months &lt;- gsub(&quot;-01$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, as.character(dates)) data_urls &lt;- paste0(base_url, year_months, &quot;.parquet&quot;) data_paths &lt;- paste0(OUTPUT_PATH, year_months, &quot;.parquet&quot;) # FETCH AND STACK CSVS ---------------- mkdirs(OUTPUT_PATH) # download all csvs in the data range for (i in 1:length(data_urls)) { # download to disk download.file(data_urls[i], data_paths[i]) } 8.2 Stack/combine raw source files In a next step, we parse and combine the downloaded data. Depending on how you want to further work with the gathered data, one or the other storage format might be more convenient. For the sake of illustration (and the following examples building on the downloaded data), we store the downloaded data in one CSV file. To this end, we make use of the arrow package, an R-interface to the Apache Arrow C++ library (a platform to work with large-scale columnar data). The aim of the exercise is to combine the downloaded parquet files into one compressed CSV file, which will be easier accessible for some of the libraries used in further examples. We start by installing the arrow package in the following way. # install arrow Sys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL = &quot;false&quot;) # to enable working with compressed files install.packages(&quot;arrow&quot;) # might take a while The setting LIBARROW_MINIMAL= \"false\" ensures that the installation of arrow is not restricted to the very basic functionality of the package. Specifically, for our context it will be important that the arrow-installation allows for the reading of compressed files. # SET UP --------------------------- # load packages library(arrow) library(data.table) library(purrr) # fix vars INPUT_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/tlc_trips/&quot; OUTPUT_FILE &lt;- &quot;data/tlc_trips.parquet&quot; OUTPUT_FILE_CSV &lt;- &quot;data/tlc_trips.csv&quot; # list of paths to downloaded parquet files all_files &lt;- list.files(INPUT_PATH, full.names = TRUE) # LOAD, COMBINE, STORE ---------------------- # read parquet files all_data &lt;- lapply(all_files, read_parquet, as_data_frame = FALSE) # combine all arrow tables into one combined_data &lt;- lift_dl(concat_tables)(all_data) # write combined dataset to csv file write_csv_arrow(combined_data, file = OUTPUT_FILE_CSV, include_header = TRUE) Note that the in the code example above we use purr::lift_dl() (lift_dl(concat_tables)(all_data)) to facilitate the code. The arrow-function concat_tables takes several 8.3 Aside: CSV import and memory allocation Consider the first steps of a data pipeline in R. The first part of our script to import and clean the data looks as follows. ########################################################### # Flights data import and preparation ########################################################### # SET UP ----------------- # fix variables DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/flights.csv&quot; # DATA IMPORT ---------------- flights &lt;- read.csv(DATA_PATH) # DATA PREPARATION -------- flights &lt;- flights[,-1:-3] When running this script, we notice that some of the steps need a noticeable amount of time to process. Moreover, while none of these steps obviously involves a lot of computation (such as a matrix inversion or numerical optimization), it quite likely involves memory allocation. We first read data into RAM (allocated to R by our operating system). It turns out that there are different ways to allocate RAM when reading data from a CSV file. Depending on the amount of data to be read in, one or the other approach might be faster. We first investigate the RAM allocation in R with mem_change() and mem_used(). # SET UP ----------------- # fix variables DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/flights.csv&quot; # load packages library(pryr) # check how much memory is used by R (overall) mem_used() ## 1.74 GB # check the change in memory due to each step # DATA IMPORT ---------------- mem_change(flights &lt;- read.csv(DATA_PATH)) ## 4.04 MB # DATA PREPARATION -------- flights &lt;- flights[,-1:-3] # check how much memory is used by R now mem_used() ## 1.74 GB The last result is kind of interesting. The object flights must have been larger right after importing it than at the end of the script. We have thrown out several variables, after all. Why does R still use that much memory? R does by default not ‘clean up’ memory unless it is really necessary (meaning no more memory is available). In this case, R has still way more memory available from the operating system, thus there is no need to ‘collect the garbage’ yet. However, we can force R to collect the garbage on the spot with gc(). This can be helpful to better keep track of the memory needed by an analytics script. gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used ## Ncells 6810720 363.8 10502018 560.9 10502018 ## Vcells 170313815 1299.4 411498500 3139.5 285640615 ## (Mb) ## Ncells 560.9 ## Vcells 2179.3 Now, let’s see how we can improve the performance of this script with regard to memory allocation. Most memory is allocated when importing the file. Obviously, any improvement of the script must still result in importing all the data. However, there are different ways to read data into RAM. read.csv() reads all lines of a csv file consecutively. In contrast, data.table::fread() first ‘maps’ the data file into memory and only then actually reads it in line by line. This involves an additional initial step, but the larger the file, the less relevant is this first step with regard to the total time needed to read all the data into memory. By switching on the verbose option, we can actually see what fread is doing. # load packages library(data.table) # DATA IMPORT ---------------- flights &lt;- fread(DATA_PATH, verbose = TRUE) ## OpenMP version (_OPENMP) 201511 ## omp_get_num_procs() 12 ## R_DATATABLE_NUM_PROCS_PERCENT unset (default 50) ## R_DATATABLE_NUM_THREADS unset ## R_DATATABLE_THROTTLE unset (default 1024) ## omp_get_thread_limit() 2147483647 ## omp_get_max_threads() 12 ## OMP_THREAD_LIMIT unset ## OMP_NUM_THREADS unset ## RestoreAfterFork true ## data.table is using 6 threads with throttle==1024.

Note in particular the following line under step [7] in the procedure: Estimated number of rows: 30960501 / 92.03 = 336403 Initial alloc = 370043 rows (336403 + 9%) using bytes/max(mean-2*sd,min) clamped between [1.1*estn, 2.0*estn] This is the result of the above mentioned preparatory step in the form of sampling. The fread CSV parser first estimates how large the data set likely is, and then creates an additional allocation (in this case of 370043 rows). Only after that the rows are actually imported into RAM. The summary of the time allocated for the different steps shown at the bottom of the output nicely illustrates the preparatory steps of memory mapping and allocation are rather fast compared with the time needed to actually read the data into RAM. Let’s put it all together and look at the memory changes and . For a fair comparison, we first have to delete flights and collect the garbage with gc(). # SET UP ----------------- # fix variables DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/flights.csv&quot; # load packages library(pryr) library(data.table) # housekeeping flights &lt;- NULL gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used ## Ncells 6800124 363.2 10502018 560.9 10502018 ## Vcells 167148445 1275.3 411498500 3139.5 285640615 ## (Mb) ## Ncells 560.9 ## Vcells 2179.3 # check the change in memory due to each step # DATA IMPORT ---------------- mem_change(flights &lt;- fread(DATA_PATH)) ## 35.8 MB 8.4 Efficient local data storage In this section, we are concerned with a) how we can store large data sets permanently on a mass storage device in an efficient way (here, efficient can be understood as ‘not taking up too much space’) and b) how we can load (parts of) this data set in an efficient way (here, efficient~fast) for analysis. We look at this problem in two situations: The data needs to be stored locally (e.g., on the hard disk of our laptop). The data can be stored on a server ‘in the cloud’. Various tools have been developed over the last few years to improve the efficiency of storing and accessing large amounts of data. Many of which go beyond the scope implied by this book’s perspective on applied data analytics. Here, we focus on the basic concept of SQL/Relational Database Systems (RDBMS), as well as a few alternatives that can be summarized under the term NoSQL (‘non-SQL’, sometimes ‘Not only SQL’) database systems. Conveniently (and counter what the latter name would suggest), most of these tools can be worked with by using basic SQL queries to load/query data. The relational database system follows the relational data model, in which the data is organized in several tables that are connected via some unique data record identifiers (keys). Such systems, for example, SQLite introduced in Chapter 3, have been used for a long time in all kind of business and analytics contexts. They are well-tried and stable and have a large and diverse user base. There are many technicalities involved in how they work under the hood, but for our purposes mainly three characteristics are relevant: All common RDBMS like SQLite and MySQL are row-based databases. That is data is thought of as observations/data records stored in rows of a table. One record consists of one row. They are typically made for storing clean data in a clearly defined set of tables, with clearly defined properties. The organizing of data in various tables has (at least for our perspective here) the aim of avoiding redundancies and thereby using the available storage space more efficiently. Rows are indexed according to the unique identifiers of tables (or one or several other variables in a table). This allows for fast querying of specific records and efficient merging/joining of tables. While these particular features work very well also with large amounts of data, particularly for exploration and data preparation (joining tables), in the age of big data they might be more relevant for operational databases (in the backend of web applications, or simply the operational database of a business), than for the specific purpose of data analytics. On the one hand, the data basis of an analytics project might be simpler in terms of the number of tables involved. On the other hand big data, as we have seen, might come in less structured and/or more complex forms than traditional table-like/row-based data. NoSQL databases have been developed for the purposes of storing more complex/less structured data, which might not necessarily described as a set of tables connected via keys, and for the purpose of fast analysis of large amounts of data. Again, three main characteristics of these types of databases are of particular relevance here: Typically, NoSQL databases are not row-based, but follow a column-based, document-based, key-value-based, or graph-based data model. In what follows, the column-based model is most relevant. … NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling. That is, scaling such a database out over many nodes of a computing cluster is usually straightforward. They are optimized to give quick answers based on summarizing large amounts of data, such as frequency counts and averages (sometimes by using approximations rather than exact computations.) In the following examples, we will particularly highlight the practical differences between using column-based and row-based data storage solutions. Conceptually, in a row-based database individual values (cells) are contained in rows, which means changing one value requires updating a row. Row-based databases (e.g., SQLite) are thus designed for efficient data reading and writing when users often access many columns but rather few observations. For example, for an operational database in the back-end of a web application such as an online shop a row-based approach makes sense because hundreds or thousands of users (customers in that case) constantly add or query small amounts of data. In contrast, changing a value in column-based databases means changing a column. Accessing all values in a particular column is much faster in comparison to row-based databases. This means that column-based databases are useful when users tend to query rather few columns but massive amounts of observations, which is typically rather the case in an analytics context. Some well-known data warehouse and data lake systems are therefore based on this principle (e.g., Google BigQuery). However, if analytics tasks involve a lot of (out-of-memory) table joins, column-based solutions are likely slower than row-based solutions. We therefore have a close look at using both column-based and row-based tools. 8.4.1 RDBMS basics RDBMSs have two key features that tackle the two efficiency concerns mentioned above: The relational data model: The overall data set is split by columns (covariates) into tables in order to reduce the storage of redundant variable-value repetitions. The resulting database tables are then linked via key-variables (unique identifiers). Thus (simply put), each type of entity on which observations exist resides in its own database table. Within this table, each observation has it’s unique id. Keeping the data in such a structure is very efficient in terms of storage space used. Indexing: The key-columns of the database tables are indexed, meaning (in simple terms) ordered on disk. Indexing a table takes time but it has to be performed only once (unless the content of the table changes). The resulting index is then stored on disk as part of the database. These indices substantially reduce the number of disk accesses required to query/find specific observations. Thus, they make the loading of specific parts of the data for analysis much more efficient. The loading/querying of data from an RDBMS typically involves the selection of specific observations (rows) and covariates (columns) from different tables. Due to the indexing, observations are selected efficiently, and the defined relations between tables (via keys) facilitate the joining of columns to a new table (the queried data). 8.4.2 Efficient data access: indices and joins in SQLite So far we have only had a look at the very basics of writing SQL code. Let us now further explore SQLite as an easy-to-use and easy-to-set-up relational database solution. In a second step we then look at how to connect to a local SQLite database from within R. First, we switch to the Terminal tab in RStudio, set up a new database called air.sqlite, and import the csv-file flights.csv (used in previous chapters) as a first table. # switch to data directory cd data # create database and run sqlite sqlite3 air.sqlite -- import csvs .mode csv .import flights.csv flights We check if everything worked out well via the .tables and .schema commands. .tables .schema flights In flights, each row describes a flight (the day it took place, its origin, its destination etc.). It contains a covariate carrier containing the unique ID of the respective airline/carrier carrying out the flight as well as the covariates origin and dest. The latter two variables contain the unique IATA-codes of the airports from which the flights departed and where they arrived, respectively. In flights we thus have observations at the level of individual flights. Now we extend our database in a meaningful way, following the relational data model idea. First we download two additional csv files containing data that relate to the flights table: airports.csv: Describes the locations of US Airports (relates to origin and dest). carriers.csv: A listing of carrier codes with full names (relates to the carrier-column in flights. In this code example, the two csvs have already been downloaded to the materials/data-folder. -- import airport data .mode csv .import airports.csv airports .import carriers.csv carriers -- inspect the result .tables .schema airports .schema carriers Now we can run our first query involving the relation between tables. The aim of the exercise is to query flights data (information on departure delays per flight number and date; from the flights-table) for all United Air Lines Inc.-flights (information from the carriers table ) departing from Newark Intl airport (information from the airports-table). In addition, we want the resulting table ordered by flight number. For the sake of the exercise, we only show the first 10 results of this query (LIMIT 10). SELECT year, month, day, dep_delay, flight FROM (flights INNER JOIN airports ON flights.origin=airports.iata) INNER JOIN carriers ON flights.carrier = carriers.Code WHERE carriers.Description = &#39;United Air Lines Inc.&#39; AND airports.airport = &#39;Newark Intl&#39; ORDER BY flight LIMIT 10; Table 8.1: Displaying records 1 - 10 year month day dep_delay flight 2013 1 4 0 1 2013 1 5 -2 1 2013 3 6 1 1 2013 2 13 -2 3 2013 2 16 -9 3 2013 2 20 3 3 2013 2 23 -5 3 2013 2 26 24 3 2013 2 27 10 3 2013 1 5 3 10 Note that this query has been executed without indexing any of the tables first. Thus SQLite could not take any ‘shortcuts’ when matching the ID columns in order to join the tables for the query output. That is, SQLite had to scan the entire columns to find the matches. Now we index the respective id columns and re-run the query. CREATE INDEX iata_airports ON airports (iata); CREATE INDEX origin_flights ON flights (origin); CREATE INDEX carrier_flights ON flights (carrier); CREATE INDEX code_carriers ON carriers (code); Note that SQLite optimizes the efficiency of the query without our explicit instructions. If there are indices it can use to speed up the query, it will do so. SELECT year, month, day, dep_delay, flight FROM (flights INNER JOIN airports ON flights.origin=airports.iata) INNER JOIN carriers ON flights.carrier = carriers.Code WHERE carriers.Description = &#39;United Air Lines Inc.&#39; AND airports.airport = &#39;Newark Intl&#39; ORDER BY flight LIMIT 10; Table 8.2: Displaying records 1 - 10 year month day dep_delay flight 2013 1 4 0 1 2013 1 5 -2 1 2013 3 6 1 1 2013 2 13 -2 3 2013 2 16 -9 3 2013 2 20 3 3 2013 2 23 -5 3 2013 2 26 24 3 2013 2 27 10 3 2013 1 5 3 10 You find the final air.sqlite, including all the indices and tables as materials/data/air_final.sqlite in the course’s code repository. 8.5 Connecting R to RDBMS The R-package RSQLite embeds SQLite in R. That is, it provides functions that allow us to use SQLite directly from within R. You will see that the combinaiton of SQLite with R is a simple but very practical approach to work with very efficiently (and locally) stored data sets. In the following example, we explore how RSQLite can be used to set up and query the air.sqlite shown in the example above. 8.5.1 Creating a new database with RSQLite Similarly to the raw SQLite-syntax, connecting to a database that does not exist yet, actually creates this (empty database). Note that for all interactions with the database from within R, we need to refer to the connection (here: con_air). # load packages library(RSQLite) # initiate the database con_air &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), &quot;data/air.sqlite&quot;) 8.5.2 Importing data With RSQLite we can easily add data.frames as SQLite tables to the database. # import data into current R sesssion flights &lt;- fread(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;) airports &lt;- fread(&quot;data/airports.csv&quot;) carriers &lt;- fread(&quot;data/carriers.csv&quot;) # add tables to database dbWriteTable(con_air, &quot;flights&quot;, flights) dbWriteTable(con_air, &quot;airports&quot;, airports) dbWriteTable(con_air, &quot;carriers&quot;, carriers) 8.5.3 Issue queries Now we can query the database from within R. By default, RSQLite returns the query results as data.frames. Queries are simply character strings written in SQLite. # define query delay_query &lt;- &quot;SELECT year, month, day, dep_delay, flight FROM (flights INNER JOIN airports ON flights.origin=airports.iata) INNER JOIN carriers ON flights.carrier = carriers.Code WHERE carriers.Description = &#39;United Air Lines Inc.&#39; AND airports.airport = &#39;Newark Intl&#39; ORDER BY flight LIMIT 10; &quot; # issue query delays_df &lt;- dbGetQuery(con_air, delay_query) delays_df # clean up dbDisconnect(con_air) When done working with the database, we close the connection to the database with dbDisconnect(con). 8.6 Cloud solutions for (big) data storage As outlined in the previous section, RDBMSs are a very practical tool to store the structured data of an analytics project locally in a database. A local SQLite database can easily be set up and accessed via R, allowing to write the whole data pipeline from data gathering to filtering, aggregating and finally analyzing in R. In contrast to directly working with CSV files, using SQLite has the advantage of organizing the data access much more efficiently in terms of RAM. Only the final result of a query is really loaded fully into R’s memory. If mass storage space is too sparse or if RAM is nevertheless not sufficient, even when organizing data access via SQLite, several cloud solutions come to the rescue. Although you could also rent a traditional web server and host a SQL database there, this is usually not worth the while for a data analytics project. In the next section we thus look at three important cases of how to store data as part of an analytics project: RDBMS in the cloud, a serverless data warehouse solution for large datasets called Google BigQuery, and a simple storage service to use as a data lake called AWS S3. All of these solutions are discussed from a data analytics perspective, and for all of these solutions we will look at how to make use of them from within R. 8.6.1 Easy-to-use RDBMS in the cloud: AWS RDS Once we have set up RStudio Server on an EC2 instance, we can run the SQLite examples shown above on it. There are no additional steps needed to install SQLite. However, when using RDBMSs in the cloud, we typically have a more sophisticated implementation than SQLite in mind. Particularly, we want to set up an actual RDBMS-server running in the cloud to which several clients can connect (e.g., via RStudio Server). AWS’ Relational Database Service (RDS) provides an easy way to set up and run a SQL database in the cloud. The great advantage for users new to RDBMS/SQL is that you do not have to manually set up a server (e.g. a EC2 instance) and install/configure the SQL server. Instead you can directly set up a fully functioning relational database in the cloud. In a first step, open the AWS console and search for/select “RDS” in the search bar. Then, click on “Create database” in the lower part of the landing page. Figure 8.1: Create a managed relational database on AWS RDS. On the next page, select “Easy create”, “MySQL”, and the “Free tier” DB instance size. Further down you will have to set the database instance identifier the user name and a password. Figure 8.2: Easy creation of a RDS MySQL DB. Once the database instance is ready, you will see it in the databases overview. Click on the DB identifier (the name of your database shown in the list of databases) and click on modify (button in the upper-right corner). In the “Connectivity” panel under “Additional configuration”, select Publicly accessible (this is necessary to interact with the DB from your local machine), and save the settings. Back on the overview page of your database, under “Connectivity &amp; security”, click on the link under the VPC security groups, scroll down and select the “Inbound rules” tab. Edit the inbound rule to allow any IP4 inbound traffic.37 Figure 8.3: Allow all IP4 inbound traffic (set Source to 0.0.0.0/0). Now we can connect to the instance via the RMySQL package. Before loading data, we first have to initiate a new database (in contrast, this is done automatically when connecting to a SQLite database). # load packages library(RMySQL) library(data.table) # fix vars RDS_ENDPOINT &lt;- &quot;MY-ENDPOINT&quot; # replace this with the Endpoint shown in the AWS RDS console PW &lt;- &quot;MY-PW&quot; # replace this with the password you have set when initiating the RDS DB on AWS # connect to DB con_rds &lt;- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host=RDS_ENDPOINT, port=3306, username=&quot;admin&quot;, password=PW) # initiate a new database on the MySQL RDS instance dbSendQuery(con_rds, &quot;CREATE DATABASE air&quot;) # disconnect and re-connect directly to the new DB dbDisconnect(con_rds) con_rds &lt;- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host=RDS_ENDPOINT, port=3306, username=&quot;admin&quot;, dbname=&quot;air&quot;, password=PW) RMySQL and RSQLite are both building on the DBI package, which generalizes how we can interact with SQL-type databases via R. This makes it straightforward to apply what we have learned so far by interacting with our local SQLite database to interactions with other databases. As soon as the connection to the new database is established, we can essentially use the same R functions as above to create new tables and import data. # import data into current R sesssion flights &lt;- fread(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;) airports &lt;- fread(&quot;data/airports.csv&quot;) carriers &lt;- fread(&quot;data/carriers.csv&quot;) # add tables to database dbWriteTable(con_rds, &quot;flights&quot;, flights) dbWriteTable(con_rds, &quot;airports&quot;, airports) dbWriteTable(con_rds, &quot;carriers&quot;, carriers) Finally, we can query our RDS MySQL database on AWS. # define query delay_query &lt;- &quot;SELECT year, month, day, dep_delay, flight FROM (flights INNER JOIN airports ON flights.origin=airports.iata) INNER JOIN carriers ON flights.carrier = carriers.Code WHERE carriers.Description = &#39;United Air Lines Inc.&#39; AND airports.airport = &#39;Newark Intl&#39; ORDER BY flight LIMIT 10; &quot; # issue query delays_df &lt;- dbGetQuery(con_rds, delay_query) delays_df # clean up dbDisconnect(con_rds) 8.7 Column-based analytics databases As outlined in the discussion of row-based vs. column based databases above, many data analytics tasks focus on few columns but many rows, hence making column-based databases the better option for large-scale analytics purposes. Apache Druid is one such solution that has particular advantages for the data analytics perspective taken in this book. It can easily be run on a local machine (Linux and Mac/OSX), or on a cluster in the cloud, and it easily allows for connections to external data, for example, data stored on Google Cloud Storage. Moreover, it can be interfaced with RDruid to run Druid queries from within R, or, yet again, directly query Druid via SQL. To get started with Apache Druid, navigate to https://druid.apache.org/. Under downloads you will find a link to download the latest stable release (at the time of writing this book: 24.0.0). On the Apache Druid landing page you will also find a link Quickstart with all the details regarding the installation and set up. Importantly, as of the time of writing this book, only Linux and MacOSX was supported (Windows is not supported). 8.7.1 Installation and start up On Linux, follow these steps to set up Apache Druid on your machine. First, open a terminal and download the Druid binary to the location in which you want to work with Druid. First, we download and unpack the current Apache Druid version via the terminal. Using Druid in its most basic form is then straightforward. Simply navigate to the unpacked folder and run ./bin/start-micro-quickstart. # navigate to local copy of druid cd apache-druid-24.0.0 # start up druid (basic/minimal settings) ./bin/start-micro-quickstart 8.7.2 First steps via Druid’s GUI Once all Druid services are running, open a new browser window and navigate to http://localhost:8888. This will open Druid’s graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides easy-to-use interfaces with all basic Druid services, ranging from the loading of data to the querying via Druid’s SQL. Figure @:druidstart highlights the GUI-buttons mentioned in the instructions below. Figure 8.4: Apache Druid GUI starting page. White boxes highlight buttons to the Druid services discussed in the main text (from left to right): the query editor (run Druid SQL queries on any of the loaded datasources directly here); the data load service (use this to import data from local files); and the Datasources console (lists all currently available data sources). 8.7.2.1 Load data into Druid In a first step, we will import the TLC taxi trips dataset from the locally stored CSV file. To do so, click on Load data/Batch - classic, then click on Start new batch spec and then select Local disk. On the right side of the Druid GUI, a menu will open. In the Base directory field, enter the path to the local directory in which you have stored the TLC taxi trips CSV-file used in the examples above (../data/).38 In the File filter-field enter tlc_trips.csv.39 Finally click on the Apply- button. Figure 8.5: Apache Druid GUI: CSV parse menu for classic batch data ingestion. The first few lines of the raw data will appear in the Druid console. In the lower-right corner of the console, click on Next: Parse data. Druid will automatically guess the delimiter used in the CSV (following the examples above, this is ,.) and present the first few parsed rows. If all looks good, click on Next: Parse time in the lower-right corner of the console. Druid is implemented to work particularly fast on time-series and panel data. To this end, it expects you to define a main time-variable in your dataset, which then can be used to index and partition your overall dataset in order to speed up queries for specific time frames. Per default, Druid will suggest to use the first column that looks like a time format (in the TLC-data this would be column 2, the pick-up time of a trip, which seems very reasonable for the sake of this example). We move on with a click on Next: Transform in the lower right corner. Druid allows you, right at the step of loading data, to add or transform variables/columns. As we do not need to change anything at this point, we continue with Next: Filter in the lower right corner. At this stage you can filter out rows/observations of which you are sure that they should not be included in any of the queries/analysis performed later on via Druid. For this example, we do not filter out any observations and continue via Next: Configure schema in the lower-right corner. Druid guesses the schema/data types for each column based on sampling the first few observations in the dataset. Notice, for example, how Druid considers vendor_name to be a string and Trip_distance to be a double (a 64-bit floating point number). In most applications of Druid for the data analytics perspective of this book, the guessed data types will be just fine. We will leave the data types as is, and keep the original column/variable names. You can easily change names of variables/columns by double-clicking on the corresponding column name, which will open a menu on the right side of the console. With this, all the main parameters to load the data are defined. What follows has to do with optimizing Druid’s performance. Once you click on Next: Partition in the lower-right corner, you will have to choose the primary partitioning, which is always based on time (again, this has to do with Druid being optimized to work on large time-series and panel datasets). Basically, you need to decide whether the data should be organized into chunks per year, month, week, etc. For this example, we will segment the data according to months. To this end, from the drop-down menu under Segment granularity choose month. For the rest of the parameters, we keep the default values. Continue by clicking on Next: Tune (we do not change anything here) and then on Next: Publish. In the appearing menu you can choose the name under which the TLC taxi trips data should be listed in the Datasources menu on your local Druid installation, once all the data is loaded/processed. Thinking of SQL queries when working with Druid, the Datasource name is what you then will use in the FROM-statement of a Druid SQL query (in analogy to a table-name in the case of RDBMSs like SQLite). We keep the suggested name tlc_trips. Thus, you can click on Edit spec in the lower-right corner. An editor-window will open and display all your load configurations as a JSON file. Do only change anything at this step if you really know what you are doing. Finally, click on Submit in the lower-right corner. This will trigger the loading of data into Druid. As in the case of the RDBMS covered above, the data ingestion or data loading process primarily involves indexing and writing data to disk. It does not mean importing data to RAM. Since the CSV file used in this example is rather large, this process can take several minutes on a modern laptop computer. Once the data ingestion is finished, click on the Datasources tab in the top menu bar to verify the ingestion. The tlc_trips-dataset should now appear in the list of data sources in Druid. Figure 8.6: Apache Druid: Datasources console. 8.7.2.2 Query Druid via the GUI SQL console Once the data is loaded into Druid, we can directly query it via the SQL console in Druid’s GUI. To do this, navigate in Druid to Query. To illustrate the strengths of Druid as an analytic database, we run an extensive data aggregation query. Specifically, we count the number of cases (trips) per vendor and split the no. of trips per vendor further per payment type. SELECT vendor_name, Payment_Type, COUNT(*) AS Count_trips FROM tlc_trips GROUP BY vendor_name, Payment_Type Note that for such simple queries, Druid SQL is essentially identical to the SQL-dialects covered in previous chapters and subsections, which makes it rather simple for beginners to start productively engaging with Druid. SQL queries can directly be entered in the query tab, a click on Run will send the query to Druid, and the results are shown right below. Figure 8.7: Apache Druid query console with Druid-SQL example: count the number of cases per vendor and payment type. The counting the number of taxi trips per vendor name and payment type implies using the entire dataset of over 27 million rows (1.5GB). Nevertheless, Druid needs less than a second and hardly any RAM to compute the results. 8.7.3 Querey Druid from R Apache provides high-level interfaces to Druid for several languages common in data science/data analytics. The RDruid-package provides such a Druid connector for R. The package can be installed from GitHub via the devtools-package. # install devtools if necessary if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) { install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)} # install RDruid devtools::install_github(&quot;druid-io/RDruid&quot;) The RDruid-package provides several high-level functions to issue specific Druid queries, however, the syntax might not be straightforward for beginners, and the package has not been further developed for many years. Thanks to Druid’s basic architecture as a web application, there is a simple alternative to the RDruid-package. Druid accepts queries via HTTP POST calls (with SQL queries embedded in a JSON file sent in the HTTP body). The data is then returned as a compressed JSON-string in the HTTP response to the POST request. We can build on that to implement our own simple druid()-function to query Druid from R. # initiate R function to query Druid (locally) druid &lt;- function(query){ # dependencies require(jsonlite) require(httr) require(data.table) # basic POST body base_query &lt;- &#39;{ &quot;context&quot;: { &quot;sqlOuterLimit&quot;: 1001, &quot;sqlQueryId&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}, &quot;header&quot;: true, &quot;query&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;resultFormat&quot;: &quot;csv&quot;, &quot;sqlTypesHeader&quot;: false, &quot;typesHeader&quot;: false }&#39; param_list &lt;- fromJSON(base_query) # add SQL-query param_list$query &lt;- query # send query, parse result resp &lt;- POST(&quot;http://localhost:8888/druid/v2/sql&quot;, body = param_list, encode = &quot;json&quot;) parsed &lt;- fread(content(resp, as = &quot;text&quot;, encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;)) return(parsed) } Now we can send queries to our local Druid installation. Importantly, Druid needs to be started up in order to make this work. In the example below we start up Druid from within R via system(\"apache-druid-24.0.0/bin/start-micro-quickstart\") (make sure that the working directory is set correctly before running this). Then, we send the same query as in the Druid GUI example from above. # start Druid system(&quot;apache-druid-24.0.0/bin/start-micro-quickstart&quot;, intern = FALSE, wait = FALSE) Sys.sleep(20) # wait for Druid to start up # query tlc data query &lt;- &#39; SELECT vendor_name, Payment_Type, COUNT(*) AS Count_trips FROM tlc_trips GROUP BY vendor_name, Payment_Type &#39; result &lt;- druid(query) ## Loading required package: jsonlite ## ## Attaching package: &#39;jsonlite&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## flatten ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## flatten, toJSON ## Loading required package: httr # inspect result result ## vendor_name Payment_Type Count_trips ## 1: CMT Cash 9618583 ## 2: CMT Credit 2737111 ## 3: CMT Dispute 16774 ## 4: CMT No Charge 82142 ## 5: DDS CASH 1332901 ## 6: DDS CREDIT 320411 ## 7: VTS CASH 10264988 ## 8: VTS Credit 3099625 8.8 Data warehouses Unlike RMDBSs, the main purpose of data warehouses is usually analytics and not the provision of data for every-day operations. Generally, data warehouses contain well-organized and well-structured data, but are not as stringent as RMDBS when it comes to organizing data in relational tables. Typically, they build on a table-based logic, but allow for nesting structures and more flexible storage approaches. They are designed to contain large amounts of data (via horizontal scaling) and are usually column-based. For the perspective on big data analytics taken in this book, there are several suitable and easily accessible data warehouse solutions provided in the cloud. In the following example, we will introduce one such solution called Google BigQuery. 8.8.1 Data warehouse for analytics: Google BigQuery example Google BigQuery is flexible regarding the upload and export of data, and can be set up straightforwardly for a data analytics project with hardly any set up costs. The pricing schema is usage-based. Unless you store massive amounts of data on it, you will only be charged for the TB of data processed. Moreover, there is a straightforward R-interface to Google BigQuery called bigrquery, which allows for the same R/SQL-syntax as R’s interfaces to traditional relational databases. 8.8.1.1 Get started with bigrquery To get started with Google BigQuery and bigrquery, go to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery. Click on “Try Big Query” (if new to this) or “Go to console” (if used previously). Create a Google Cloud project to use BigQuery with. Note that, as in general for Google Cloud services, you need to have a credit card registered with the project to do this. However, for learning and testing purposes, Google Cloud offers 1TB of free queries per month. All the examples shown below combined will not exceed this free tier. Finally, run install.packages(\"bigrquery\") in R. To set up an R-session to interface with BigQuery, you need to indicate which Google BigQuery project you want to use for the billing (the BILLING variable in the example below), as well as the Google BigQuery project in which the data is stored that you want to query (the PROJECT-variable below). This distinction is very useful because it easily allows you to query data from a large array of publicly available datasets on BigQuery. In the set up example code below, we use this option in order to access an already existing and publicly available dataset (provided in the bigquery-public-data project) called google_analytics_sample. In fact, this dataset provides the raw Google Analytics data used in the Big-P example discussed in Chapter 2. Finally, all that is left to do is to connect to BigQuery via the already familiar dbConnect()-function provided in DBI.40 When first connecting to and querying BigQuery with your Google Cloud account, a browser window will open and you will be prompted to grand bigrquery access to your account/project. To do so, you will have to be logged in to your Google account. See the Important details-section on https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/ for details on the authentication. # load packages, credentials library(bigrquery) library(data.table) library(DBI) # fix vars BILLING &lt;- &quot;bda-examples&quot; # the project ID on BigQuery (billing must be enabled) PROJECT &lt;- &quot;bigquery-public-data&quot; # the project name on BigQuery DATASET &lt;- &quot;google_analytics_sample&quot; # connect to DB on BigQuery con &lt;- dbConnect( bigrquery::bigquery(), project = PROJECT, dataset = DATASET, billing = BILLING ) 8.8.1.2 Get familiar with BigQuery The basic query syntax is now essentially identical to what we have covered in the RDBMS examples above.41 In this first query, we count the number of times a Google merchandise shop visit originates from a given web domain on the first of August 2017 (hence the query to table ga_sessions_20170801). Note the way we refer to the specific table (bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801): bigquery-public-data is the pointer to the BigQuery project, google_analytics_sample is the name of the database (data warehouse), and ga_sessions_20170801 is the name of the specific table we want to query data from. Finally, note the argument page_size=15000 as part of the familiar dbGetQuery()-function. This ensures that bigrquery is not exceeding the limit of volume per second for downloads via the Google BigQuery API (on which bigrquery builds). # run query query &lt;- &quot; SELECT DISTINCT trafficSource.source AS origin, COUNT(trafficSource.source) AS no_occ FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801` GROUP BY trafficSource.source ORDER BY no_occ DESC; &quot; ga &lt;- as.data.table(dbGetQuery(con, query, page_size=15000)) head(ga) Note the output displayed in the console. bigrquery indicates how much data volume was processed as part of the query (which indicates what will be charged to your billing project), 8.8.1.3 Upload data to BigQuery Storing your entire raw dataset on BigQuery is straightforward with bigrquery. In the following simple example, we upload the previously gathered and locally stored TLC tax trips data. To do so, we first create and connect to a new dataset on BigQuery. To keep things simple, we initiate the new datasat in the same project used for the billing. # name of the dataset to be created DATASET &lt;- &quot;tlc&quot; # connect and initiate a new dataset con &lt;- dbConnect( bigrquery::bigquery(), project = BILLING, billing = BILLING, dataset = DATASET ) In a first step, we create the dataset to which we then can add the table. tlc_ds &lt;- bq_dataset(BILLING, DATASET) bq_dataset_create(tlc_ds) We then load the TLC dataset into R via fread() and upload it as a new table to your project/dataset on BigQuery via bigrquery. For the sake of the example, we only upload the first 10,000 rows. # read data from csv tlc &lt;- fread(&quot;data/tlc_trips.csv.gz&quot;, nrows = 10000) # write data to a new table dbWriteTable(con, name = &quot;tlc_trips&quot;, value = tlc) Alternatively, you can easily upload data via the Google BigQuery console in the browser. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery, select (or create) the project you want to upload data to, then in the Explorer section click on + ADD DATA, and select the file you want to upload. You can either upload the data from disk, from Google Cloud Storage, or from a third-party connection. Uploading the data into BigQuery via Google Cloud Storage is particularly useful for large data sets. Finally, we can test the newly created dataset/table with the following query test_query &lt;- &quot; SELECT * FROM tlc.tlc_trips LIMIT 10 &quot; test &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, test_query) 8.8.1.4 Tutorial: Retrieve and prepare Google Analytics data The following tutorial illustrates how the raw data for the Big-P example in Chapter 2 was collected and prepared via Google BigQuery and R. Before we get started, note an important aspect of a data warehouse solution like BigQuery in contrast to common applications of RDBS. As data warehouses are used in a more flexible way than relational databases, it is not uncommon to store data files/tables containing the same variables separately in various tables, for example to store one table per day or year of a panel dataset. On Google BigQuery, this partitioning of datasets into several components can additionally make sense for cost reasons. Suppose you want to only compute summary statistics for certain variables over a given time frame. If all observations of a large dataset are stored in one standard BigQuery table, such a query results in processing GBs or TBs of data, as the observations from the corresponding time frame need to be filtered out of the entire dataset. Partitioning the data into several subsets helps avoid this, as BigQuery has several features that allow the definition of SQL queries to be run on partitioned data. The publicly available Google Analytics dataset is organized in such a partitioned way. The data is stored in several tables (one for each day of the observation period), whereby the last few characters of the table name contain the date of the corresponding observation day (such as the one used in the example above: ga_sessions_20170801). If we want to combine data from several of those tables, we can use the wildcard character (*) to indicate that the BigQuery should consider all tables matching the table name up to the *: FROM bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*. We proceed by first connecting the R session with GoogleBigQuery. # documents raw data processing # load packages, credentials (if not loaded yet) # library(bigrquery) # library(data.table) # library(DBI) # fix vars BILLING &lt;- &quot;YOUR-BILLING-PROJECT-ID&quot; # the project ID on BigQuery (billing must be enabled) PROJECT &lt;- &quot;bigquery-public-data&quot; # the project name on BigQuery DATASET &lt;- &quot;google_analytics_sample&quot; # connect to DB on BigQuery con &lt;- dbConnect( bigrquery::bigquery(), project = PROJECT, dataset = DATASET, billing = BILLING ) The query combines all Google Analytics data recorded from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2017 via WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160101' AND '20171231'. This gives us all the raw data used in the Big-P analysis shown in Chapter 2. # run query query &lt;- &quot; SELECT totals.visits, totals.transactions, trafficSource.source, device.browser, device.isMobile, geoNetwork.city, geoNetwork.country, channelGrouping FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*` WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN &#39;20160101&#39; AND &#39;20171231&#39;; &quot; ga &lt;- as.data.table(dbGetQuery(con, query, page_size=15000)) Finally, we use data.table and basic R to prepare the final analytic dataset and write it on disk. # further cleaning and coding via data.table and basic R ga$transactions[is.na(ga$transactions)] &lt;- 0 ga &lt;- ga[ga$city!=&quot;not available in demo dataset&quot;,] ga$purchase &lt;- as.integer(0&lt;ga$transactions) ga$transactions &lt;- NULL ga_p &lt;- ga[purchase==1] ga_rest &lt;- ga[purchase==0][sample(1:nrow(ga[purchase==0]), 45000)] ga &lt;- rbindlist(list(ga_p, ga_rest)) potential_sources &lt;- table(ga$source) potential_sources &lt;- names(potential_sources[1&lt;potential_sources]) ga &lt;- ga[ga$source %in% potential_sources,] # store dataset on local hard disk fwrite(ga, file=&quot;data/ga.csv&quot;) # clean up dbDisconnect(con) Note how we combine BigQuery as our data warehouse with basic R for data preparation. Solutions like BigQuery are particularly useful for this kind of approach as part of an analytics project: large operations such as the selection of columns/variables from large-scale data sources are handled within the warehouse in the cloud, and the refinement/cleaning steps can then be implemented locally on a much smaller subset.42 Note the wildcard-character (*) in the query is used to fetch data from several partitions of the overall dataset. 8.9 Data lakes and simple storage service Broadly speaking a data lake is where all your data resides (these days, this is typically somewhere in the cloud). The data is simply stored in whatever file format and in simple terms organized in folders and sub-folders. In the same data lake you might thus store CSV files, SQL database dumps, log files, image files, raw text, etc. In addition, you typically have many options to define access rights to files, including to easily make them accessible for download to the public. For a simple data analytics project in the context of economic research or business analytics. The data lake in the cloud concept is a useful tool to store all project-related raw data files. On the one hand you avoid running into troubles with occupying gigabytes or terabytes of your local hard disk with files that are relevant but only rarely imported/worked with. On the other hand you can properly organize all the raw data for reproducibility purposes and easily share the files with colleagues (and eventually the public). For example, you can use one main folder (one “bucket”) for an entire analytics project, store all the raw data in one sub-folder (for reproduction purposes), and all the final analytic datasets in another sub-folder for replication purposes and more frequent access as well as sharing across a team of co-workers. There are several types of cloud-based data lake solutions available, many of which are primarily focused on corporate data storage and provide a variety of services (for example, AWS Lake Formation or Azure Data Lake) that might go well beyond the data analytics perspective taken in this book. However, most of these solutions build in the end on a so-called simple storage service such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, which build the core of the lake, the place where the data is actually stored and accessed. In the following, we will look at how to use such a simple storage service (AWS S3) as a data lake in simple analytics projects.43 Finally, we will look at a very interesting approach to combine the concept of a data lake with the concept of a data warehouse. That is, we briefly look at solutions of how some analytics tools (specifically, a tool called AWS Athena) can directly be used to query/analyze the data stored in the simple storage service. 8.9.1 AWS S3 with R: first steps For the following first steps with AWS S3 and R, you will need an AWS account (same as above for EC2) and IAM credentials from your AWS account with the right to access S3.44 Finally, you will have to install the aws.s3 package in R in order to access S3 via R: install.packages(\"aws.s3\"). To initiate an R session in which you connect to S3, aws.s3 must be loaded and the following environment variables must be set: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: your access key id (of the keypair with rights to use S3) AWS_SECRET_KEY: your access key (of the keypair with rights to use S3) REGION: the region in which your S3 buckets are/will be located (e.g., \"eu-central-1\") # load packages library(aws.s3) # set environment variables with your AWS S3 credentials Sys.setenv(&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&quot; = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, &quot;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&quot; = AWS_SECRET_KEY, &quot;AWS_DEFAULT_REGION&quot; = REGION) In a first step, we create a project bucket (the main repository for our project) to store all the data of our analytics project. All the raw data can directly be placed in this main folder. Then, we add one sub-folder to this bucket: analytic_data (for the cleaned/prepared datasets underlying the analyses in the project).45 # fix variable for bucket name BUCKET &lt;- &quot;tlc-trips&quot; # create project bucket put_bucket(BUCKET) # create folders put_folder(&quot;raw_data&quot;, BUCKET) put_folder(&quot;analytic_data&quot;, BUCKET) 8.9.2 Uploading data to S3 Now we can start uploading the data to the bucket (and the sub-folder). For example, to remain within the context of the TLC taxi trips data, we upload the original parquet files directly to the bucket, and the prepared CSV file to analytic_data. For large files (larger than 100MB) it is recommended to use the multipart option (upload of file in several parts; multipart=TRUE). # upload to bucket # final analytic dataset put_object( file = &quot;data/tlc_trips.csv&quot;, # the file you want to upload object = &quot;analytic_data/tlc_trips.csv&quot;, # the name the file will have in the S3 bucket bucket = BUCKET, multipart = TRUE ) # upload raw data file_paths &lt;- list.files(&quot;data/tlc_trips/raw_data&quot;, full.names = TRUE) lapply(file_paths, put_object, bucket=BUCKET, multipart=TRUE) 8.9.3 More than just simple storage: S3 + AWS Athena ## ## Attaching package: &#39;aws.s3&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:pryr&#39;: ## ## object_size There are several implementations of interfaces with AWS Athena in R. Here, we will rely on AWR.Athena (run install.packages(\"AWR.Athena\")), which allows interacting with AWS Athena via the familiar DBI-package. # SET UP ------------------------- #install.packages(&quot;AWR.Athena&quot;) # load packages library(DBI) library(aws.s3) # aws credentials with Athena and S3 rights AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID &lt;- &quot;YOUR_KEY_ID&quot; AWS_ACCESS_KEY &lt;- &quot;YOUR_KEY&quot; REGION &lt;- &quot;eu-central-1&quot; # establish aws connection Sys.setenv(&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&quot; = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, &quot;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&quot; = AWS_ACCESS_KEY, &quot;AWS_DEFAULT_REGION&quot; = REGION) Create a bucket for the output. OUTPUT_BUCKET &lt;- &quot;bda-athena&quot; put_bucket(OUTPUT_BUCKET, region=&quot;us-east-1&quot;) Now we can connect to AWS Athena to query data from files in S3 via the RJDBC-package. # load packages library(RJDBC) library(DBI) # download Athena JDBC driver URL &lt;- &quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/athena-downloads/drivers/JDBC/AthenaJDBC_1.1.0/AthenaJDBC41-1.1.0.jar&quot; DRV_FILE &lt;- &quot;AthenaJDBC41-1.1.0.jar&quot; download.file(URL, destfile = DRV_FILE) # connect to JDBC athena &lt;- JDBC(driverClass=&quot;com.amazonaws.athena.jdbc.AthenaDriver&quot;, DRV_FILE, identifier.quote=&quot;&#39;&quot;) # connect to Athena con &lt;- dbConnect(athena, &#39;jdbc:awsathena://athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443/&#39;, s3_staging_dir=&quot;s3://bda-athena&quot;, user=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, password=AWS_ACCESS_KEY) In order to query data stored in S3 via AWS Athena we need to create an external table in Athena, which will be based on data stored in S3. query_create_table &lt;- &quot; CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE default.trips ( `vendor_name` string, `Trip_Pickup_DateTime` string, `Trip_Dropoff_DateTime` string, `Passenger_Count` int, `Trip_Distance` double, `Start_Lon` double, `Start_Lat` double, `Rate_Code` string, `store_and_forward` string, `End_Lon` double, `End_Lat` double, `Payment_Type` string, `Fare_Amt` double, `surcharge` double, `mta_tax` string, `Tip_Amt` double, `Tolls_Amt` double, `Total_Amt` double ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY &#39;,&#39; STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION &#39;s3://tlc-trips/analytic_data/&#39; &quot; dbSendQuery(con, query_create_table) Run a test query to verify the table. test_query &lt;- &quot; SELECT * FROM default.trips LIMIT 10 &quot; test &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, test_query) test ## vendor_name trip_pickup_datetime ## 1 VTS 2009-01-31 18:47:00 ## 2 VTS 2009-01-31 18:44:00 ## 3 VTS 2009-01-31 19:40:00 ## 4 VTS 2009-01-31 11:29:00 ## 5 VTS 2009-01-31 12:23:00 ## 6 VTS 2009-01-31 13:41:00 ## 7 VTS 2009-01-31 14:50:00 ## 8 VTS 2009-01-31 19:35:00 ## 9 VTS 2009-01-31 17:15:00 ## 10 VTS 2009-01-21 14:48:00 ## trip_dropoff_datetime passenger_count trip_distance ## 1 2009-01-31 18:54:00 1 1.32 ## 2 2009-01-31 18:58:00 1 1.77 ## 3 2009-01-31 19:50:00 1 2.23 ## 4 2009-01-31 11:32:00 1 0.76 ## 5 2009-01-31 12:27:00 1 0.74 ## 6 2009-01-31 13:58:00 1 3.31 ## 7 2009-01-31 14:54:00 1 0.85 ## 8 2009-01-31 19:54:00 1 2.15 ## 9 2009-01-31 17:19:00 1 0.97 ## 10 2009-01-21 15:04:00 4 2.30 ## start_lon start_lat rate_code store_and_forward ## 1 -74.00 40.74 ## 2 -73.99 40.76 ## 3 -73.98 40.74 ## 4 -73.97 40.77 ## 5 -73.98 40.78 ## 6 -73.98 40.79 ## 7 -73.98 40.77 ## 8 -73.98 40.74 ## 9 -73.97 40.80 ## 10 -73.98 40.74 ## end_lon end_lat payment_type fare_amt surcharge ## 1 -73.99 40.74 CASH 6.1 0 ## 2 -74.00 40.73 CASH 8.9 0 ## 3 -73.98 40.76 Credit 9.7 0 ## 4 -73.96 40.77 CASH 4.1 0 ## 5 -73.98 40.79 CASH 4.5 0 ## 6 -73.97 40.76 CASH 11.7 0 ## 7 -73.99 40.76 CASH 4.5 0 ## 8 -74.00 40.74 Credit 10.9 0 ## 9 -73.97 40.79 CASH 4.9 0 ## 10 -74.01 40.73 CASH 10.1 0 ## mta_tax tip_amt tolls_amt total_amt ## 1 0.0 0 6.1 ## 2 0.0 0 8.9 ## 3 2.0 0 11.7 ## 4 0.0 0 4.1 ## 5 0.0 0 4.5 ## 6 0.0 0 11.7 ## 7 0.0 0 4.5 ## 8 1.1 0 12.0 ## 9 0.0 0 4.9 ## 10 0.0 0 10.1 Finally, close the connection. dbDisconnect(con) ## [1] TRUE 8.10 Wrapping up It is good practice to set up all of the high-level pipeline in the same language (here: R). This substantially facilitates your workflow and makes your overall pipeline easier to maintain. Importantly, as illustrated in the sections above, this practice does not mean that all of the underlying data processing is actually done in R. We simply use R as the highest-level layer, and call a range of services under the hood in order to handle each of the pipeline components as efficient as possible. Appache Arrow allows you to combine and correct raw data without exceeding RAM, in addition it facilitates working with newer (big) data formats for columnar data storage systems (like Apache Parquet). RDBMS such as SQLite or MySQL and analytics data bases such as Druid help you store and organize clean/structured data for analytics purposes locally or in the cloud. RDBMS like SQLite are row-based (changing a value means changing a row), while modern analytics data bases are usually column-based (changing a value means modifying one column). Row-based databases are recommended when your analytics workflow includes a lot of tables, table joins, and frequent filtering for specific observations with variables from several tables. Column-based databases are recommended for analytics workflows involving less frequent but large-scale data aggregation tasks. Data warehouse solutions like Google Big Query are useful to store and query large (semi-)structured datasets, but are more flexible regarding hierarchical data and file formats than traditional RDBMS. Data lakes and simple storage services are the all-purpose tools to store vast amounts of data in any format in the cloud. Typically, solutions like AWS S3 are a great option to store all of the raw data related to a data analytics project. Note that this is not generally recommendable. Only do this to get familiar with the service and to test some code.↩︎ Importantly, recall that with this set up, Druid is currently running from within the apache-druid-24.0.0-directory. Hence, unless you have copied your data into this directory, you will have to explicitly point to data files outside of this directory (via ../).↩︎ The Druid service to load data per default allows you to point to various files here via the wildcard character (*). As we have stored all the taxi trip example data in one CSV-file, we can directly point to this one file.↩︎ The bigrquery-package provides a DBI-driver for BigQuery. For more advanced usage of bigrquery, the package also provides lower-level functions to directly interact with the BigQuery API.↩︎ Minor but relevant exceptions are that SQLite, MySQL, and BigQuery do not provide all the same SQL commands. However, for all core operations to query and summarize data the SQL syntax is essentially identical.↩︎ Since in this example the queried subset is not particularly large, it is easier to perform the data preparation locally in R. However, in other situations it might make sense to use SQL in BigQuery more extensively for data preparation tasks that would require a lot of RAM.↩︎ Essentially all other major cloud computing providers offer very similar services with very similar features as AWS S3. Conceptually, you could thus easily use one of these other services. The examples here focus on AWS S3 primarily for simplicity (as we already have set up AWS credentials etc.), and the straightforward way of how to connect to AWS S3 via R.↩︎ There are many ways of how to create these credentials, or which ones to use. A very simply and reasonable instruction of how to do this can be found here: https://binaryguy.tech/aws/s3/create-iam-user-to-access-s3/.↩︎ Note that, technically, the explicit creation of folders is not necessary, as S3 uses slashes (/) in file names on S3 to make them look like being placed in a particular folder. However, when using the AWS S3 console in the browser, defining folders explicitly can make more sense for the users’ perspective.↩︎ "],["big-data-cleaning-and-transformation.html", "Chapter 9 Big Data Cleaning and Transformation 9.1 Out-of-memory strategies and lazy evaluation: practical basics 9.2 ff Big Data Preparation Tutorial 9.3 arrow Big Data Preparation Tutorial 9.4 Wrapping up", " Chapter 9 Big Data Cleaning and Transformation Preceding the filtering/selection/aggregation of raw data, data cleaning and transformation typically have to be run on large volumes of raw data, before the observations and variables of interest can be further analyzed. Typical data cleaning tasks involve: Normalization/standartization (across entities, categories, observation periods). Coding of additional variables (indicators, strings to categorical, etc.). Removing/adding covariates. Merging/joining data sets. Properly defining data types for each variable. All of these steps are very common tasks when working with data for analytics purposes, independent of the size of datasets. However, as most of the techniques and software developed for such tasks is meant to process data in memory, performing these tasks on rather big datasets can be challenging. Data cleaning workflows you are perfectly familiar with might slow down substantially or crash due to a lack of memory (RAM), particularly if the data preparation step involves merging/joining two datasets. Other potential bottle-necks are the parsing of large files (CPU), or the intense reading from and writing to the hard disk (Mass storage). In practice, the most critical bottleneck of common data preparation tasks is often a lack of RAM. In the following, we thus explore two strategies that broadly build on the idea of virtual memory (using parts of the hard disk as RAM) and/or lazy evaluation (only loading/processing the part of a dataset really required). 9.1 Out-of-memory strategies and lazy evaluation: practical basics Virtual memory is in simple words an approach to combining the RAM and mass storage components in order to cope with a lack of RAM. Modern operating systems come with a virtual memory manager that would automatically handle the swapping between RAM and the hard-disk, when running processes that use up too much RAM. However, a virtual memory manager is not specifically developed to perform this task in the context of data analysis. Several strategies have thus been developed to build on the basic idea of virtual memory in the context of data analysis tasks. Chunked data files on disk: The data analytics software ‘partitions’ the data set, maps, and stores the chunks of raw data on disk. What is actually ‘read’ into RAM when importing the data file with this approach is the mapping to the partitions of the actual data set (the data structure) and some metadata describing the data set. In R, this approach is implemented in the ff package and several packages building on ff. In this approach, the usage of disk space and the linking between RAM and files on disk is very explicit (and well visible to the user). Memory mapped files and shared memory: The data analytics software uses segments of virtual memory for the data set and allows different programs/processes to access it in the same memory segment. Thus, virtual memory is explicitly allocated for one or several specific data analytics tasks. In R, this approach is prominently implemented in the bigmemory package and several packages building on bigmemory. A conceptually related but differently focused approach is the lazy evaluation implemented in Apache Arrow and the corresponding arrow package. While Apache Arrow is basically a platform for in-memory columnar data, it is optimized for processing large amounts of data and working with datasets that actually do not fit into memory. The way this is done is that instructions on what to do with a dataset are not evaluated step-by-step on the spot bot all together at the point of actually loading the data into R. That is, we can connect to a dataset via arrow, see its variables, etc., give instructions of what observations to filter out and what columns to select, all before we actually start reading the data into RAM. In comparison to the strategies outlined above, this approach is usually much faster but might still lead to a situation with a lack of memory. The following subsections we briefly look at how to set up an R session for data preparation purposes with either of the approaches (ff, bigmemory, arrow), and look at some of the conceptual basics behind these approaches. 9.1.1 Chunking data with the ff-package We first install and load the ff and ffbase packages, as well as the pryr package. We use the already known flights.csv-data set^[Data from the same source is also used in the code examples given in Kane, Emerson, and Weston (2013). For the sake of the example, we only use a fraction of the original data set.46 On disk, the dataset is about 30MB: fs::file_size(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;) ## 29.5M However, loading the entire dataset of several GBs would work just fine, using the ff-approach. When importing data via the ff package, we first have to set up a directory where ff can store the partitioned data set (recall that this is explicitly/visibly done on disk). We call this new directory ff_files. # SET UP -------------- # install.packages(c(&quot;ff&quot;, &quot;ffbase&quot;)) # load packages library(ff) library(ffbase) library(data.table) # for comparison # create directory for ff chunks, and assign directory to ff system(&quot;mkdir ff_files&quot;) options(fftempdir = &quot;ff_files&quot;) Now we can read in the data with read.table.ffdf. In order to better understand the underlying concept, we also import the data into common data.table- object via fread() and then look at the size of the objects resulting from the two ‘import’ approaches in the R environment with object.size(). # usual in-memory csv import flights_dt &lt;- fread(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;) # out-of-memory approach flights &lt;- read.table.ffdf(file=&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, VERBOSE=TRUE, header=TRUE, next.rows=100000, colClasses=NA) ## read.table.ffdf 1..100000 (100000) csv-read=0.462sec ffdf-write=0.06sec ## read.table.ffdf 100001..200000 (100000) csv-read=0.38sec ffdf-write=0.036sec ## read.table.ffdf 200001..300000 (100000) csv-read=0.394sec ffdf-write=0.062sec ## read.table.ffdf 300001..336776 (36776) csv-read=0.145sec ffdf-write=0.022sec ## csv-read=1.381sec ffdf-write=0.18sec TOTAL=1.561sec # compare object sizes object.size(flights) # out-of-memory approach ## 949976 bytes object.size(flights_dt) # common data.table ## 32569024 bytes Note that there are two substantial differences to what we have previously seen when using fread(). It takes much longer to import a csv into the ff_files structure. However, the RAM allocated to it is much smaller. This is exactly what we would expect, keeping in mind what read.table.ffdf() does in comparison to what fread() does. Now we can actually have a look at the data chunks created by ff. # show the files in the directory keeping the chunks head(list.files(&quot;ff_files&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;ffdf197d105b279c.ff&quot; &quot;ffdf197d124e325a.ff&quot; ## [3] &quot;ffdf197d140f395.ff&quot; &quot;ffdf197d2041a514.ff&quot; ## [5] &quot;ffdf197d23f656d6.ff&quot; &quot;ffdf197d2ad96f86.ff&quot; 9.1.2 Memory mapping with bigmemory The bigmemory-package handles data in matrices, and therefore only accepts data values of identical data type. Before importing data via the bigmemory-package, we thus have to ensure that all variables in the raw data can be imported in a common type. # SET UP ---------------- # load packages library(bigmemory) library(biganalytics) # import the data flights &lt;- read.big.matrix(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, type=&quot;integer&quot;, header=TRUE, backingfile=&quot;flights.bin&quot;, descriptorfile=&quot;flights.desc&quot;) Note that, similar to the ff-example, read.big.matrix() initiates a local file-backing flights.bin on disk which is linked to the flights-object in RAM. From looking at the imported file, we see that various variable values have been discarded. This is due to the fact that we have forced all variables to be of type \"integer\" when importing the data set. summary(flights) ## min max mean ## year 2013.000 2013.000 2013.000 ## month 1.000 12.000 6.549 ## day 1.000 31.000 15.711 ## dep_time 1.000 2400.000 1349.110 ## sched_dep_time 106.000 2359.000 1344.255 ## dep_delay -43.000 1301.000 12.639 ## arr_time 1.000 2400.000 1502.055 ## sched_arr_time 1.000 2359.000 1536.380 ## arr_delay -86.000 1272.000 6.895 ## carrier 9.000 9.000 9.000 ## flight 1.000 8500.000 1971.924 ## tailnum ## origin ## dest ## air_time 20.000 695.000 150.686 ## distance 17.000 4983.000 1039.913 ## hour 1.000 23.000 13.180 ## minute 0.000 59.000 26.230 ## time_hour 2013.000 2014.000 2013.000 ## NAs ## year 0.000 ## month 0.000 ## day 0.000 ## dep_time 8255.000 ## sched_dep_time 0.000 ## dep_delay 8255.000 ## arr_time 8713.000 ## sched_arr_time 0.000 ## arr_delay 9430.000 ## carrier 318316.000 ## flight 0.000 ## tailnum 336776.000 ## origin 336776.000 ## dest 336776.000 ## air_time 9430.000 ## distance 0.000 ## hour 0.000 ## minute 0.000 ## time_hour 0.000 object.size(flights) ## 696 bytes Again, the object representing the dataset in R does not contain the actual data (it does not even take up a KB of memory). 9.1.3 Connecting to Apache Arrow # SET UP ---------------- # load packages library(arrow) # import the data flights &lt;- read_csv_arrow(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, as_data_frame = FALSE) Note the as_data_frame=FALSE in the function call. This instructs arrow to only read some of the data (to know what is in the file) and establish a connection to the file, but not actually importing all the csv. summary(flights) ## Length Class Mode ## year 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## month 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## day 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## dep_time 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## sched_dep_time 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## dep_delay 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## arr_time 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## sched_arr_time 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## arr_delay 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## carrier 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## flight 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## tailnum 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## origin 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## dest 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## air_time 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## distance 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## hour 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## minute 336776 ChunkedArray environment ## time_hour 336776 ChunkedArray environment object.size(flights) ## 488 bytes Again, we notice that the flights-object is much smaller than the actual dataset on disk. 9.2 ff Big Data Preparation Tutorial 9.2.1 Set up The following examples are based on Walkowiak (2016), Chapter 3. You can download the original data sets used in these examples from the book’s GitHub repository. The set up for our analysis script involves the loading of the ff and ffbase packages, the intitiation of fix variables to hold the paths to the data sets, as well as the creation and assignment of a new local directory ff_files in which the binary flat files-partitioned chunks of the original data sets will be stored. ## SET UP ------------------------ # create and set directory for ff files system(&quot;mkdir ff_files&quot;) options(fftempdir = &quot;ff_files&quot;) # load packages library(ff) library(ffbase) library(pryr) # fix vars FLIGHTS_DATA &lt;- &quot;data/flights_sep_oct15.txt&quot; AIRLINES_DATA &lt;- &quot;data/airline_id.csv&quot; 9.2.2 Data import In a first step we read (or ‘upload’) the data into R. This step involves the creation of the binary chunked files as well as the mapping of these files and the metadata. In comparison to the traditional read.csv approach, you will notice two things. On the one hand the data import takes longer, on the other hand it uses up much less RAM than than with read.csv. # DATA IMPORT ------------------ # check memory used mem_used() ## 1.78 GB # 1. Upload flights_sep_oct15.txt and airline_id.csv files from flat files. system.time(flights.ff &lt;- read.table.ffdf(file=FLIGHTS_DATA, sep=&quot;,&quot;, VERBOSE=TRUE, header=TRUE, next.rows=100000, colClasses=NA)) ## read.table.ffdf 1..100000 (100000) csv-read=0.539sec ffdf-write=0.074sec ## read.table.ffdf 100001..200000 (100000) csv-read=0.562sec ffdf-write=0.061sec ## read.table.ffdf 200001..300000 (100000) csv-read=0.562sec ffdf-write=0.06sec ## read.table.ffdf 300001..400000 (100000) csv-read=0.586sec ffdf-write=0.062sec ## read.table.ffdf 400001..500000 (100000) csv-read=0.585sec ffdf-write=0.063sec ## read.table.ffdf 500001..600000 (100000) csv-read=0.588sec ffdf-write=0.062sec ## read.table.ffdf 600001..700000 (100000) csv-read=0.594sec ffdf-write=0.062sec ## read.table.ffdf 700001..800000 (100000) csv-read=0.568sec ffdf-write=0.063sec ## read.table.ffdf 800001..900000 (100000) csv-read=0.586sec ffdf-write=0.062sec ## read.table.ffdf 900001..951111 (51111) csv-read=0.302sec ffdf-write=0.044sec ## csv-read=5.472sec ffdf-write=0.613sec TOTAL=6.085sec ## user system elapsed ## 5.231 0.753 6.096 system.time(airlines.ff &lt;- read.csv.ffdf(file= AIRLINES_DATA, VERBOSE=TRUE, header=TRUE, next.rows=100000, colClasses=NA)) ## read.table.ffdf 1..1607 (1607) csv-read=0.011sec ffdf-write=0.005sec ## csv-read=0.011sec ffdf-write=0.005sec TOTAL=0.016sec ## user system elapsed ## 0.016 0.001 0.023 # check memory used mem_used() ## 1.78 GB Comparison with read.table ##Using read.table() system.time(flights.table &lt;- read.table(FLIGHTS_DATA, sep=&quot;,&quot;, header=TRUE)) ## user system elapsed ## 4.858 0.630 5.547 #gc() system.time(airlines.table &lt;- read.csv(AIRLINES_DATA, header = TRUE)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.002 0.000 0.002 # check memory used mem_used() ## 1.92 GB 9.2.3 Inspect imported files A particularly useful aspect of working with the ff-package and the packages building on them is that many of the simple R functions that work on usual data.frames in RAM also work on ff_filess. Hence, without actually having loaded the entire raw data of a large data set into RAM, we can quickly get an overview of the key characteristics such as the number of observations and the number of variables. # 2. Inspect the ff_files objects. ## For flights.ff object: class(flights.ff) ## [1] &quot;ffdf&quot; dim(flights.ff) ## [1] 951111 28 ## For airlines.ff object: class(airlines.ff) ## [1] &quot;ffdf&quot; dim(airlines.ff) ## [1] 1607 2 9.2.4 Data cleaning and transformation After inspecting the data, we go through several steps of cleaning and transformation, with the goal of then merging the two data sets. That is, we want to create a new data set that contains detailed flights information but with additional information on the carriers/airlines. First, we want to rename some of the variables. # step 1: ## Rename &quot;Code&quot; variable from airlines.ff to &quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot; and &quot;Description&quot; into &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot;. names(airlines.ff) &lt;- c(&quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot;, &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot;) names(airlines.ff) ## [1] &quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot; &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot; str(airlines.ff[1:20,]) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 20 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ AIRLINE_ID: int 19031 19032 19033 19034 19035 19036 19037 19038 19039 19040 ... ## $ AIRLINE_NM: Factor w/ 1607 levels &quot;40-Mile Air: Q5&quot;,..: 945 1025 503 721 64 725 1194 99 1395 276 ... Now we can join the two data sets via the unique airline identifier \"AIRLINE_ID\". Note that these kind of operations would usually take up substantially more RAM on the spot, if both original data sets would also be fully loaded into RAM. As illustrated by the mem_change()-function, this is not the case here. All that is needed is a small chunk of RAM to keep the metadata and mapping-information of the new ff_files object, all the actual data is cached on the hard disk. # merge of ff_files objects mem_change(flights.data.ff &lt;- merge.ffdf(flights.ff, airlines.ff, by=&quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot;)) ## 775 kB #The new object is only 551.2 Kb in size class(flights.data.ff) ## [1] &quot;ffdf&quot;

This last step is also quite common in practice. The initial raw data set is very large, thus we perform all the theoretically very memory-intense tasks of preparing the analytic data set via ff and then store the (often much smaller) analytic data set in a more accessible csv file in order to later read it into RAM and run more computationally intense analyses directly in RAM. # Export subs1.ff into CSV and TXT files: write.csv.ffdf(subs1.ff, &quot;subset1.csv&quot;) 9.3 arrow Big Data Preparation Tutorial We begin by initializing our R session like in the short arrow introduction above. # SET UP ---------------- # load packages library(arrow) # fix vars FLIGHTS_DATA &lt;- &quot;data/flights_sep_oct15.txt&quot; AIRLINES_DATA &lt;- &quot;data/airline_id.csv&quot; # import the data flights &lt;- read_csv_arrow(FLIGHTS_DATA, as_data_frame = FALSE) airlines &lt;- read_csv_arrow(AIRLINES_DATA, as_data_frame = FALSE) We then follow the exact same steps as in the ff-tutorial above. # step 1: ## Rename &quot;Code&quot; variable from airlines.ff to &quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot; and &quot;Description&quot; into &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot;. names(airlines) &lt;- c(&quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot;, &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot;) names(airlines) ## [1] &quot;AIRLINE_ID&quot; &quot;AIRLINE_NM&quot; 9.4 Wrapping up Typically, the raw/uncleaned data is the critical bottleneck in terms of data volume. Particularly as the selection and filtering of the overall dataset in preparation of analytic datasets can only work properly with cleaned data. Out-of-memory strategies are based on the concept of virtual memory and are key to cleaning large amounts of data locally. The ff-package provides a high-level R-interface to an out-of-memory approach. Most functions in ff and the corresponding ffbase-package come with a syntax very similar to the basic R syntax for data cleaning and manipulation. The basic idea behind ff is to store the data in chunked format in easy-accessible way on the hard disk and only keep the metadata of a dataset (e.g. variable names) in an R object in RAM while working on the dataset. The arrow-package offers a similar functionality on a slightly different approach called lazy evaluation (only evaluate data manipulation/cleaning tasks once the data is pulled into R). Unlike ff, arrow closly follows the dplyr-syntax rather than basic R syntax for data cleaning tasks.

Here, we explore the options for split-apply-combine approaches to large data sets that do not fit into RAM. 10.1.1 Data aggregation with chunked data files In this tutorial we explore the world of New York’s famous Yellow Caps. In in a first step, we will focus on the ff-based approach to employ parts of the hard disk as ‘virtual memory’. This means, all of the examples are easily scalable without risking too much memory pressure. Given the size of the entire TLC database (over 200GB), we will only use one million taxi trips records of January 2009.48 10.1.1.1 Data import First, we read the raw taxi trips records into R with the ff-package. # load packages library(ff) library(ffbase) # set up the ff directory (for data file chunks) if (!dir.exists(&quot;fftaxi&quot;)){ system(&quot;mkdir fftaxi&quot;) } options(fftempdir = &quot;fftaxi&quot;) # # import a few lines of the data, setting the column classes explicitly # col_classes &lt;- c(V1 = &quot;factor&quot;, # V2 = &quot;POSIXct&quot;, # V3 = &quot;POSIXct&quot;, # V4 = &quot;integer&quot;, # V5 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V6 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V7 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V8 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V9 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V10 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V11 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V12 = &quot;factor&quot;, # V13 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V14 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V15 = &quot;factor&quot;, # V16 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V17 = &quot;numeric&quot;, # V18 = &quot;numeric&quot;) # import the first one million observations taxi &lt;- read.table.ffdf(file = &quot;data/tlc_trips.csv&quot;, sep = &quot;,&quot;, header = TRUE, next.rows = 100000, # colClasses= col_classes, nrows = 1000000 ) Following the data documentation provided by TLC, we give the columns of our data set more meaningful names and remove the empty columns (some covariates are only collected in later years). # # first, we remove the empty vars V8 and V9 # taxi$V8 &lt;- NULL # taxi$V9 &lt;- NULL # # # # set covariate names according to the data dictionary # # see https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf # # note instead of taxizonne ids, long/lat are provided # # varnames &lt;- c(&quot;vendor_name&quot;, # &quot;pickup_time&quot;, # &quot;dropoff_time&quot;, # &quot;Passenger_Count&quot;, # &quot;trip_distance&quot;, # &quot;start_lat&quot;, # &quot;start_long&quot;, # &quot;dest_lat&quot;, # &quot;dest_long&quot;, # &quot;Payment_Type&quot;, # &quot;fare_amount&quot;, # &quot;extra&quot;, # &quot;mta_tax&quot;, # &quot;Tip_Amt&quot;, # &quot;tolls_amount&quot;, # &quot;Total_Amt&quot;) # names(taxi) &lt;- varnames When inspecting the factor variables of the data set, we notice that some of the values are not standardized/normalized and the resulting factor levels are, therefore, somewhat ambiguous. We better clean this before getting into data aggregation tasks. Note the ff-specific syntax needed to recode the factor. # inspect the factor levelsf levels(taxi$Payment_Type) ## [1] &quot;Cash&quot; &quot;CASH&quot; &quot;Credit&quot; &quot;CREDIT&quot; ## [5] &quot;Dispute&quot; &quot;No Charge&quot; # recode them levels(taxi$Payment_Type) &lt;- tolower(levels(taxi$Payment_Type)) taxi$Payment_Type &lt;- ff(taxi$Payment_Type, levels = unique(levels(taxi$Payment_Type)), ramclass = &quot;factor&quot;) # check result levels(taxi$Payment_Type) ## [1] &quot;cash&quot; &quot;credit&quot; &quot;dispute&quot; &quot;no charge&quot; 10.1.1.2 Aggregation with split-apply-combine First, we have a look at whether trips paid with credit card tend to involve lower tip amounts than trips paid by cash. In order to do so, we create a table that shows the average amount of tip paid for each payment-type category. In simple words, this means we first split the data set into subsets, each of which containing all observations belonging to a distinct payment type. Then, we compute the arithmetic mean of the tip-column of each of these subsets. Finally, we combine all of these results in one table (i.e., the split-apply-combine strategy). When working with ff, the ffdfply()-function provides a user-friendly implementation of split-apply-combine type of tasks. # load packages library(doBy) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;doBy&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## orderBy, sampleBy # split-apply-combine procedure on data file chunks tip_pcategory &lt;- ffdfdply(taxi, split = taxi$Payment_Type, BATCHBYTES = 100000000, FUN = function(x) { summaryBy(Tip_Amt~Payment_Type, data = x, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)}) ## 2022-11-29 23:48:52, calculating split sizes ## 2022-11-29 23:48:52, building up split locations ## 2022-11-29 23:48:53, working on split 1/2, extracting data in RAM of 1 split elements, totalling, 0.0815 GB, while max specified data specified using BATCHBYTES is 0.09313 GB ## 2022-11-29 23:48:53, ... applying FUN to selected data ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, ... appending result to the output ffdf ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, working on split 2/2, extracting data in RAM of 3 split elements, totalling, 0.02281 GB, while max specified data specified using BATCHBYTES is 0.09313 GB ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, ... applying FUN to selected data ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, ... appending result to the output ffdf Note how the output describes the procedure step by step. Now we can have a look at the resulting summary statistic in the form of a data.frame(). as.data.frame(tip_pcategory) ## Payment_Type Tip_Amt.mean ## 1 cash 0.0008162 ## 2 credit 2.1619737 ## 3 dispute 0.0035075 ## 4 no charge 0.0041056 The result would go against our initial hypothesis. However, the comparison is a little flawed. If trips paid by credit card also tend to be longer, the result is not too surprising. We should thus look at the share of tip (or percentage), given the overall amount paid for the trip. We add an additional variable percent_tip and then repeat the aggregation exercise for this variable. # add additional column with the share of tip taxi$percent_tip &lt;- (taxi$Tip_Amt/taxi$Total_Amt)*100 # recompute the aggregate stats tip_pcategory &lt;- ffdfdply(taxi, split = taxi$Payment_Type, BATCHBYTES = 100000000, FUN = function(x) { summaryBy(percent_tip~Payment_Type, # note the difference here data = x, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)}) ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, calculating split sizes ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, building up split locations ## 2022-11-29 23:48:54, working on split 1/2, extracting data in RAM of 1 split elements, totalling, 0.08732 GB, while max specified data specified using BATCHBYTES is 0.09313 GB ## 2022-11-29 23:48:55, ... applying FUN to selected data ## 2022-11-29 23:48:55, ... appending result to the output ffdf ## 2022-11-29 23:48:55, working on split 2/2, extracting data in RAM of 3 split elements, totalling, 0.02444 GB, while max specified data specified using BATCHBYTES is 0.09313 GB ## 2022-11-29 23:48:55, ... applying FUN to selected data ## 2022-11-29 23:48:55, ... appending result to the output ffdf # show result as data frame as.data.frame(tip_pcategory) ## Payment_Type percent_tip.mean ## 1 cash 0.005978 ## 2 credit 16.004173 ## 3 dispute 0.045660 ## 4 no charge 0.040433 10.1.2 Cross-tabulation of ff vectors Also in relative terms, trips paid by credit card tend to be tipped more. However, are there actually many trips paid by credit card? In order to figure this out, we count the number of trips per payment type by applying the table.ff-function provided in ffbase. table.ff(taxi$Payment_Type) ## ## cash credit dispute no charge ## 781295 215424 536 2745 Incidentally, trips paid in cash are way more frequent than trips paid by credit card. Again using the table.ff-function, we investigate what factors might be correlated with payment types. First, we have a look at whether payment type is associated with the number of passengers in a trip. # select the subset of observations only containing trips paid by credit card or cash taxi_sub &lt;- subset.ffdf(taxi, Payment_Type==&quot;credit&quot; | Payment_Type == &quot;cash&quot;) taxi_sub$Payment_Type &lt;- ff(taxi_sub$Payment_Type, levels = c(&quot;credit&quot;, &quot;cash&quot;), ramclass = &quot;factor&quot;) # compute the cross tabulation crosstab &lt;- table.ff(taxi_sub$Passenger_Count, taxi_sub$Payment_Type ) # add names to the margins names(dimnames(crosstab)) &lt;- c(&quot;Passenger count&quot;, &quot;Payment type&quot;) # show result crosstab ## Payment type ## Passenger count credit cash ## 0 2 44 ## 1 149990 516828 ## 2 32891 133468 ## 3 7847 36439 ## 4 2909 17901 ## 5 20688 73027 ## 6 1097 3588 From the raw numbers it is hard to see whether there are significant differences between the categories cash and credit. We therefore use a visualization technique called ‘mosaic plot’ to visualize the cross-tabulation. # install.packages(vcd) # load package for mosaic plot library(vcd) ## Loading required package: grid ## ## Attaching package: &#39;grid&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:ff&#39;: ## ## pattern ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## explode # generate a mosaic plot mosaic(crosstab, shade = TRUE) The plot suggests that trips involving more than one passenger tend to be paid rather by cash than by credit card. 10.2 High-speed in-memory data aggregation with data.table For large data sets that still fit into RAM, the data.table-package provides very fast and elegant functions to compute aggregate statistics. 10.2.0.1 Data import We use the already familiar fread() to import the same first million observations from the January 2009 taxi trips records. # load packages library(data.table) # import data into RAM (needs around 200MB) taxi &lt;- fread(&quot;data/tlc_trips.csv&quot;, nrows = 1000000) 10.2.0.2 Data preparation We prepare/clean the data as in the ff-approach above. # # first, we remove the empty vars V8 and V9 # taxi$V8 &lt;- NULL # taxi$V9 &lt;- NULL # # # # set covariate names according to the data dictionary # # see https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf # # note instead of taxizonne ids, long/lat are provided # # varnames &lt;- c(&quot;vendor_name&quot;, # &quot;pickup_time&quot;, # &quot;dropoff_time&quot;, # &quot;Passenger_Count&quot;, # &quot;trip_distance&quot;, # &quot;start_lat&quot;, # &quot;start_long&quot;, # &quot;dest_lat&quot;, # &quot;dest_long&quot;, # &quot;Payment_Type&quot;, # &quot;fare_amount&quot;, # &quot;extra&quot;, # &quot;mta_tax&quot;, # &quot;Tip_Amt&quot;, # &quot;tolls_amount&quot;, # &quot;Total_Amt&quot;) # names(taxi) &lt;- varnames # clean the factor levels taxi$Payment_Type &lt;- tolower(taxi$Payment_Type) taxi$Payment_Type &lt;- factor(taxi$Payment_Type, levels = unique(taxi$Payment_Type)) Note the simpler syntax of essentially doing the same thing, but all in-memory. 10.2.0.3 data.table-syntax for ‘split-apply-combine’ operations With the []-syntax we index/subset usual data.frame objects in R. When working with data.tables, much more can be done in the step of ‘sub-setting’ the frame.49 For example, we can directly compute on columns. taxi[, mean(Tip_Amt/Total_Amt)] ## [1] 0.03452 Moreover, in the same step, we can ‘split’ the rows by specific groups and apply the function to each subset. taxi[, .(percent_tip = mean((Tip_Amt/Total_Amt)*100)), by = Payment_Type] ## Payment_Type percent_tip ## 1: cash 0.005978 ## 2: credit 16.004173 ## 3: no charge 0.040433 ## 4: dispute 0.045660 Similarly, we can use data.table’s dcast() for cross-tabulation-like operations. dcast(taxi[Payment_Type %in% c(&quot;credit&quot;, &quot;cash&quot;)], Passenger_Count~Payment_Type, fun.aggregate = length, value.var = &quot;vendor_name&quot;) ## Passenger_Count cash credit ## 1: 0 44 2 ## 2: 1 516828 149990 ## 3: 2 133468 32891 ## 4: 3 36439 7847 ## 5: 4 17901 2909 ## 6: 5 73027 20688 ## 7: 6 3588 1097 10.3 Wrapping up Similar to the MapReduce idea in the context of distributed systems, the split-apply-combine approach is key in many big data aggregation procedures on normal machines (laptop/desktop computers). The idea is to split the overall data into subsets based on a categorical variable, apply a function (e.g. mean) on each sub-set, and then combine the results in one object. Thus the approach allows for parallelization and working on separate data chunks. As computing descriptive statistics on various subsets of a large dataset can be very memory-intense, it is recommended to use out-of-memory strategies, lazy evaluation, or a classical SQL-database approach for this. There are several options available: ffdply, running on chunked datasets; arrow with group_by(); or SQLite via GROUP BY.

First, depending on the type of plot, plotting raw data consisting of many observations can take a long time (and lead to large figure-files). And, second, patterns might be harder to recognize due to the sheer amount of data displayed in a plot. Both of these challenges are particularly related to the visualization of raw data for explorative or descriptive purposes. Visualizations of already computed aggregations or estimates is typically very similar when working with large or small datasets. The following sections thus particularly highlight the issue of generating plots based on the raw data, including many observations, and with the aim of exploring the data in order to discover patterns in the data that then can be further investigated in more sophisticated statistical analyses. We will do so in three steps. First, we will look into a few important conceptual aspects where generating plots with a large number of observations becomes difficult, and then look at potentially helpful tools to address these difficulties. Based on these insights, the next section presents a data exploration tutorial based on the already familiar TLC taxi trips dataset, looking into different approaches to visualize relations between variables. Finally, the last section of this chapter covers an area of data visualization that has become more and more relevant in applied economic research with the availability of highly detailed observational data on economic and social activities (due to the digitization of many aspects of modern live): the plotting of geo-spatial information on economic activity. All illustrations of concepts and visualization examples in this chapter build on the Grammar of Graphics concept implemented in the ggplot2 package. The choice of this plotting package/framework is motivated by the large variety of plot-types covered in ggplot2 (ranging from simple scatterplots to hexbin-plots and geographic maps), as well as the flexibility to build and modify plots step by step (an aspect that is particularly interesting when exploring large datasets visually). 11.1 Challenges of big data visualization Generating a plot in an interactive R session means generating a new object in the R environment (RAM), which can (in the case of large datasets) take up a considerable amount of memory. Moreover, depending on how the plot function is called, RStudio will directly render the plot in the Plots tab (which again needs memory and processing). Consider the following simple example, in which we plot two vectors of random numbers against each other. # load package library(ggplot2) # for plotting library(pryr) # for profiling library(bench) # for profiling library(fs) # for profiling # random numbers generation x &lt;- rnorm(10^6, mean=5) y &lt;- 1 + 1.4*x + rnorm(10^6) plotdata &lt;- data.frame(x=x, y=y) object_size(plotdata) ## 16.00 MB # generate scatter plot splot &lt;- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x=x, y=y))+ geom_point() object_size(splot) ## 16.87 MB The plot object, not surprisingly, takes up an additional slice of RAM of the size of the original dataset, plus some overhead. Now when we instruct ggplot to generate/plot the visualization on canvas, even more memory is needed. Moreover, rather a lot of data processing is needed to place one million points on the canvas (also, note that one million observations would not be considered a lot in the context of this book…). mem_used() ## 2.24 GB system.time(print(splot)) ## user system elapsed ## 21.909 0.064 21.962 mem_used() ## 2.34 GB First, to generate this one plot, an average modern laptop needs about 13.6 seconds. This would not be very comfortable in a interactive session to explore the data visually. Second, and even more striking, before the plot was generated mem_used() indicated the total amount of memory (in MBs) used by R was around 160MB, while right after plotting to the canvas, R used around 270MB. Note how this is by an order of magnitude larger than the dataset and the ggplot-object. Creating the same plot based on 100 million observations would likely crash or freeze your R session. Finally, when we output the plot to a file (for example, a pdf), the generated vector-based graphic file is also rather large ggsave(&quot;splot.pdf&quot;, device=&quot;pdf&quot;, width = 5, height = 5) file_size(&quot;splot.pdf&quot;) ## 54.7M Hence generating plots visualizing large amounts of raw data tends to use up a lot of computing time, memory, and (ultimately) storage space for the generated plot file. There are a couple of solutions to address these performance issues. Avoid fancy symbols (costly rendering) It turns out that one aspect of the problem is the particular symbols/characters used in ggplot (and other plot functions in R) for the points in such a scatter-plot. Thus, one solution is to overturn the default set of characters directly when calling ggplot(). A reasonable choice of character for this purpose is simply the fullstop (.). # generate scatter plot splot2 &lt;- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x=x, y=y))+ geom_point(pch=&quot;.&quot;) mem_used() ## 2.24 GB system.time(print(splot2)) ## user system elapsed ## 1.838 0.075 1.921 mem_used() ## 2.35 GB The increase in memory due to the plot call is comparatively smaller, and plotting is substantially faster. Use rasterization (bitmap graphics) instead of vector graphics Per default most data visualization libraries, including ggplot2 are implemented to generate vector-based graphics. Conceptually, this makes a lot of sense for any type of plot when the number of observations plotted is small or moderate. In simple terms, vector-based graphics define lines and shapes as vectors in a coordinate system. In the case of a scatter-plot, the x and y coordinates of every point needs to be recorded. In contrast, bitmap files contain image information in the form of a matrix (or several matrices if colors are involved), whereby each cell of the matrix represents a pixel and contains information about the pixel’s color. While a vector-based representation of plot of few observations likely is more memory-efficient than a high-resolution bitmap representation of the same plot, it might well be the other way around when we plot millions of observations. Thus, an alternative solution to save time and memory is to directly use a bitmap format instead of a vector-based format. This could be done by plotting directly to a bitmap-format file and then open the file to look at the plot. However, this is somewhat uncomfortable as part of a data visualization workflow to explore the data. Luckily there is a ready-made solution by Kratochvíl et al. (2020) that builds on the idea of rasterizing scatter-plots, but that then displays the bitmap image directly in R. The approach is implemented in the scattermore-package and can straightforwardly be used in combination with ggplot. # install.packages(&quot;scattermore&quot;) library(scattermore) # generate scatter plot splot3 &lt;- ggplot()+ geom_scattermore(aes(x=x, y=y), data=plotdata) # show plot in interactive session system.time(print(splot3)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.739 0.087 0.834 # plot to file ggsave(&quot;splot3.pdf&quot;, device=&quot;pdf&quot;, width = 5, height = 5) file_size(&quot;splot3.pdf&quot;) ## 13K This approach is faster by an order of magnitude, and the resulting pdf takes up only a fraction of the storage space needed for splot.pdf which is based on the classical geom_points() and a vector-based image. Use aggregates instead of raw data Depending on what pattern/aspect of the data you want to inspect visually, you might not actually need to plot all observations directly but rather the result of aggregating the observations first. There are several options to do that, but in the context of scatter plots based on many observations, a 2-dimensional bin plot can be a good starting point. The idea behind this approach is to divide the canvas into grid-cells (typically in the form of rectangles or hexagons), compute for each grid cell the number of observations/points that would fall into it (in a scatter plot), and then indicate the number of observations per grid cell via the cell’s shading. Such a 2D-bin plot of the same data as above can be generated via geom_hex(): # generate scatter plot splot4 &lt;- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x=x, y=y))+ geom_hex() mem_used() ## 2.24 GB system.time(print(splot4)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.547 0.007 0.575 mem_used() ## 2.25 GB Obviously, this approach is much faster and uses up much less memory than the geom_point()- approach. Moreover, note that this approach to visualizing a potential relation between two variables based on many observations might even have another advantage over the approaches taken above. In all of the scatter plots, it was not visible whether the point cloud contains areas with substantially more observations (more density). There were simply too many points plotted over each other in order to recognize much more than the contour of the overall point cloud. With the 2-dimensional bin plot implemented with geom_hex(), we recognize immediately that there are many more observations located in the center of the cloud than further away from the center. 11.2 Data exploration with ggplot2 In this tutorial we will work with the TLC data used in the data aggregation session. The raw data consists of several monthly CSV-files and can be downloaded via the TLC’s website. Again, we work only with the first million observations. In order to better understand the large data set at hand (particularly regarding the determinants of tips paid) we use ggplot2 to visualize some key aspects of the data. First, let’s look at the raw relationship between fare paid and the tip paid. We set up the canvas with ggplot. # load packages library(ggplot2) # set up the canvas taxiplot &lt;- ggplot(taxi, aes(y=Tip_Amt, x= Fare_Amt)) taxiplot Now we visualize the co-distribution of the two variables with a simple scatter-plot. to speed things up we use geom_scattermore(), but increase the point size.50 # simple x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3) Note that this took quite a while, as R had to literally plot one million dots on the canvas. Moreover many dots fall within the same area, making it impossible to recognize how much mass there actually is. This is typical for visualization exercises with large data sets. One way to improve this, is by making the dots more transparent by setting the alpha parameter. # simple x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2) Alternatively, we can compute two-dimensional bins. Here, we use geom_bin2d() (an alternative to the geom_hex used above) in which the canvas is split into rectangles and the number of observations falling into each respective rectangle is computed. The visualization is then based on plotting the rectangles with counts greater than 0 and the shading of the rectangles indicates the count values. # 2-dimensional bins taxiplot + geom_bin2d() A large part of the tip/fare observations seem to be in the very lower-left corner of the pane, while most other trips seem to be evenly distributed. However, we fail to see slighter differences in this visualization. In order to reduce the dominance of the 2d-bins with very high counts, we display the natural logarithm of counts and display the bins as points. # 2-dimensional bins taxiplot + stat_bin_2d(geom=&quot;point&quot;, mapping= aes(size = log(..count..))) + guides(fill = FALSE) ## Warning: `guides(&lt;scale&gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. ## Please use `guides(&lt;scale&gt; = &quot;none&quot;)` instead. We note that there are many cases with very low fare amounts, many cases with no or hardly any tip, and quite a lot of cases with very high tip amounts (in relation to the rather low fare amount). In the following, we dissect this picture by having a closer look at ‘typical’ tip amounts and whether they differ by type of payment. # compute frequency of per tip amount and payment method taxi[, n_same_tip:= .N, by= c(&quot;Tip_Amt&quot;, &quot;Payment_Type&quot;)] frequencies &lt;- unique(taxi[Payment_Type %in% c(&quot;credit&quot;, &quot;cash&quot;), c(&quot;n_same_tip&quot;, &quot;Tip_Amt&quot;, &quot;Payment_Type&quot;)][order(n_same_tip, decreasing = TRUE)]) # plot top 20 frequent tip amounts fare &lt;- ggplot(data = frequencies[1:20], aes(x = factor(Tip_Amt), y = n_same_tip)) fare + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Indeed, paying no tip at all is quite frequent, overall.51 The bar plot also indicates that there seem to be some ‘focal points’ in the amount of tips paid. Clearly, paying one USD or two USD is more common than paying fractions. However, fractions of dollars might be more likely if tips are paid in cash and customers simply add some loose change to the fare amount paid. fare + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + facet_wrap(&quot;Payment_Type&quot;) Clearly, it looks like trips paid in cash tend not to be tipped (at least in this subsample). Let’s try to tease this information out of the initial points plot. Trips paid in cash are often not tipped, we thus should indicate the payment method. Moreover, tips paid in full dollar amounts might indicate a habit. # indicate natural numbers taxi[, dollar_paid := ifelse(Tip_Amt == round(Tip_Amt,0), &quot;Full&quot;, &quot;Fraction&quot;),] # extended x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, aes(color=Payment_Type)) + facet_wrap(&quot;dollar_paid&quot;) Now the picture is getting clearer. Paying tip seems to follow certain rules of thumb. Certain fixed amounts tend to be paid independent of the fare amount (visible in the straight lines of dots on the right-hand panel). At the same time, the pattern in the left panel indicates another habit: computing the amount of tip as a linear function of the total fare amount (‘pay 10% tip’). A third habit might be to determine the amount of tip by ‘rounding up’ the total amount paid. In the following, we try to tease the latter out, only focusing on credit card payments. taxi[, rounded_up := ifelse(Fare_Amt + Tip_Amt == round(Fare_Amt + Tip_Amt, 0), &quot;Rounded up&quot;, &quot;Not rounded&quot;)] # extended x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(data= taxi[Payment_Type == &quot;credit&quot;], pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, aes(color=rounded_up)) + facet_wrap(&quot;dollar_paid&quot;) Now we can start modelling. A reasonable first shot is to model the tip amount as a linear function of the fare amount, conditional on the no-zero tip amounts paid as fractions of a dollar. modelplot &lt;- ggplot(data= taxi[Payment_Type == &quot;credit&quot; &amp; dollar_paid == &quot;Fraction&quot; &amp; 0 &lt; Tip_Amt], aes(x = Fare_Amt, y = Tip_Amt)) modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Finally, we prepare the plot for reporting. ggplot2 provides several predefined ‘themes’ for plots which define all kind of aspects of a plot (background color, line colors, font size etc.). The easiest way to tweak the design of your final plot in a certain direction is to just add such a pre-defined theme at the end of your plot. Some of the pre-defined themes allow you to change a few aspects such as the font type and the base size of all the texts in the plot (labels and tick numbers etc.). Here, we use the theme_bw(), increase the font size and switch to serif-type font. theme_bw() is one of the complete themes already shipped with the basic ggplot2 installation.52 Many more themes can be found in additional R packages (see, for example, the ggthemes package). modelplot &lt;- ggplot(data= taxi[Payment_Type == &quot;credit&quot; &amp; dollar_paid == &quot;Fraction&quot; &amp; 0 &lt; Tip_Amt], aes(x = Fare_Amt, y = Tip_Amt)) modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Amount of tip paid (in USD)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Amount of fare paid (in USD)&quot;) + theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = &quot;serif&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 11.3 Aside: modify and create themes Apart from using pre-defined themes as illustrated above, we can use the theme() function to further modify the design of a plot. For example, we can print the axis labels (‘axis titles’) in bold. modelplot &lt;- ggplot(data= taxi[Payment_Type == &quot;credit&quot; &amp; dollar_paid == &quot;Fraction&quot; &amp; 0 &lt; Tip_Amt], aes(x = Fare_Amt, y = Tip_Amt)) modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Amount of tip paid (in USD)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Amount of fare paid (in USD)&quot;) + theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = &quot;serif&quot;) + theme(axis.title = element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;)) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; There is a large list of plot design aspects that can be modified in this way (see ?theme() for details). 11.3.1 Create your own theme: simple approach Extensive design modifications via theme() can involve many lines of code, making your plot code harder to read/understand. In practice, you might want to define your specific theme once and then apply this theme to all of your plots. In order to do so it makes sense to choose one of the existing themes as a basis and then modify its design aspects until you have the design you are looking for. Following the design choices in the examples above, we can create our own theme_my_serif() as follows. # &#39;define&#39; a new theme theme_my_serif &lt;- theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = &quot;serif&quot;) + theme(axis.title = element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;)) # apply it modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Amount of tip paid (in USD)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Amount of fare paid (in USD)&quot;) + theme_my_serif ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; This practical approach does not require you to define every aspect of a theme. If you indeed want completely define every aspect of a theme, you can set complete=TRUE when calling the theme function. # &#39;define&#39; a new theme my_serif_theme &lt;- theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = &quot;serif&quot;) + theme(axis.title = element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;), complete = TRUE) # apply it modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Amount of tip paid (in USD)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Amount of fare paid (in USD)&quot;) + theme_my_serif ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Note that since we have only defined one aspect (bold axis titles), the rest of the elements follow the default theme. Importantly, the approach outlined above does technically not really create a new theme like theme_bw(), as these pre-defined themes are implemented as functions. Note that we add the new theme simply with + theme_my_serif to the plot (no parentheses). In practice this is the most simple approach and it provides all the functionality you need in order to apply your own ‘theme’ to each of your plots. 11.3.2 Implementing actual themes as functions. If you really want to implement a theme as a function. The following blueprint can get you started. # define own theme theme_my_serif &lt;- function(base_size = 15, base_family = &quot;&quot;, base_line_size = base_size/170, base_rect_size = base_size/170){ theme_bw(base_size = base_size, base_family = base_family, base_line_size = base_size/170, base_rect_size = base_size/170) %+replace% # use theme_bw() as a basis but replace some design elements theme( axis.title = element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;) ) } # apply the theme # apply it modelplot + geom_scattermore(pointsize = 3, alpha=0.2, color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, colour = &quot;black&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Amount of tip paid (in USD)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Amount of fare paid (in USD)&quot;) + theme_my_serif(base_size = 18, base_family=&quot;serif&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 11.4 Visualize Time and Space The previous visualization exercises were focused on visually exploring patterns in the tipping behavior of people taking a NYC yellow cap ride. Based on the same data set, will explore the time dimension and spatial dimension of the TLC Yellow Cap data. That is, we explore where trips tend to start and end, depending on the time of the day. 11.4.1 Preparations For the visualization of spatial data we first load additional packages that give R some GIS features. # load GIS packages library(rgdal) library(rgeos) Moreover, we download and import a so-called ‘shape file’ (a geospatial data format) of New York City. This will be the basis for our visualization of the spatial dimension of taxi trips. The file is downloaded from New York’s Department of City Planning and indicates the city’s community district borders.53 # download the zipped shapefile to a temporary file, unzip URL &lt;- &quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nycd_19a.zip&quot; tmp_file &lt;- tempfile() download.file(URL, tmp_file) file_path &lt;- unzip(tmp_file, exdir= &quot;data&quot;) # delete the temporary file unlink(tmp_file) Now we can import the shape file and have a look at how the GIS data is structured. # read GIS data nyc_map &lt;- readOGR(file_path[1], verbose = FALSE) # have a look at the GIS data summary(nyc_map) ## Object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ## Coordinates: ## min max ## x 913175 1067383 ## y 120122 272844 ## Is projected: TRUE ## proj4string : ## [+proj=lcc +lat_0=40.1666666666667 +lon_0=-74 ## +lat_1=41.0333333333333 +lat_2=40.6666666666667 ## +x_0=300000 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=us-ft ## +no_defs] ## Data attributes: ## BoroCD Shape_Leng Shape_Area ## Min. :101 Min. : 23963 Min. :2.43e+07 ## 1st Qu.:206 1st Qu.: 36611 1st Qu.:4.84e+07 ## Median :308 Median : 52246 Median :8.27e+07 ## Mean :297 Mean : 74890 Mean :1.19e+08 ## 3rd Qu.:406 3rd Qu.: 85711 3rd Qu.:1.37e+08 ## Max. :595 Max. :270660 Max. :5.99e+08 Note that the coordinates are not in the usual longitude and latitude units. The original map uses a different projection than the TLC data of cap trips records. Before plotting, we thus have to change the projection to be in line with the TLC data. # transform the projection nyc_map &lt;- spTransform(nyc_map, CRS(&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0&quot;)) # check result summary(nyc_map) ## Object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ## Coordinates: ## min max ## x -74.26 -73.70 ## y 40.50 40.92 ## Is projected: FALSE ## proj4string : [+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs] ## Data attributes: ## BoroCD Shape_Leng Shape_Area ## Min. :101 Min. : 23963 Min. :2.43e+07 ## 1st Qu.:206 1st Qu.: 36611 1st Qu.:4.84e+07 ## Median :308 Median : 52246 Median :8.27e+07 ## Mean :297 Mean : 74890 Mean :1.19e+08 ## 3rd Qu.:406 3rd Qu.: 85711 3rd Qu.:1.37e+08 ## Max. :595 Max. :270660 Max. :5.99e+08 One last preparatory step is to convert the map data to a data.frame for plotting with ggplot. nyc_map &lt;- fortify(nyc_map) 11.4.2 Pick-up and drop-off locations Since trips might actually start or end outside of NYC, we first restrict the sample of trips to those within the boundary box of the map. For the sake of the exercise, we only select a random sample of 50000 trips from the remaining trip records. # taxi trips plot data taxi_trips &lt;- taxi[Start_Lon &lt;= max(nyc_map$long) &amp; Start_Lon &gt;= min(nyc_map$long) &amp; End_Lon &lt;= max(nyc_map$long) &amp; End_Lon &gt;= min(nyc_map$long) &amp; Start_Lat &lt;= max(nyc_map$lat) &amp; Start_Lat &gt;= min(nyc_map$lat) &amp; End_Lat &lt;= max(nyc_map$lat) &amp; End_Lat &gt;= min(nyc_map$lat) ] taxi_trips &lt;- taxi_trips[base::sample(1:nrow(taxi_trips), 50000)] In order to visualize how the cap traffic is changing over the course of the day, we add an additional variable called start_time in which we store the time (hour) of the day a trip started. taxi_trips$start_time &lt;- lubridate::hour(taxi_trips$Trip_Pickup_DateTime) Particularly, we want to look at differences between, morning, afternoon, and evening/night. # define new variable for facets taxi_trips$time_of_day &lt;- &quot;Morning&quot; taxi_trips[start_time &gt; 12 &amp; start_time &lt; 17]$time_of_day &lt;- &quot;Afternoon&quot; taxi_trips[start_time %in% c(17:24, 0:5)]$time_of_day &lt;- &quot;Evening/Night&quot; taxi_trips$time_of_day &lt;- factor(taxi_trips$time_of_day, levels = c(&quot;Morning&quot;, &quot;Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Evening/Night&quot;)) We initiate the plot by first setting up the canvas with our taxi trips data. Then, we add the map as a first layer. # set up the canvas locations &lt;- ggplot(taxi_trips, aes(x=long, y=lat)) # add the map geometry locations &lt;- locations + geom_map(data = nyc_map, map = nyc_map, aes(map_id = id)) locations Now we can start adding the pick-up and drop-off locations of cap trips. # add pick-up locations to plot locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=Start_Lon, y=Start_Lat), color=&quot;orange&quot;, pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) As to be expected, most of the trips start in Manhattan. Now let’s look at where trips end. # add pick-up locations to plot locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=End_Lon, y=End_Lat), color=&quot;steelblue&quot;, pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) + geom_scattermore(aes(x=Start_Lon, y=Start_Lat), color=&quot;orange&quot;, pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) Incidentally, more trips tend to end outside of Manhattan. And the destinations seem to be broader spread across the city then the pick-up locations. Most destinations are still in Manhattan, though. Now let’s have a look at how this picture changes depending on the time of the day. # pick-up locations locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=Start_Lon, y=Start_Lat), color=&quot;orange&quot;, pointsize =1, alpha = 0.2) + facet_wrap(vars(time_of_day)) # drop-off locations locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=End_Lon, y=End_Lat), color=&quot;steelblue&quot;, pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) + facet_wrap(vars(time_of_day)) Alternatively, we can plot the hours on a continuous scale. # drop-off locations locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=End_Lon, y=End_Lat, color = start_time ), pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) + scale_colour_gradient2( low = &quot;red&quot;, mid = &quot;yellow&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;, midpoint = 12) 11.5 Aside: change color schemes In the example above we use scale_colour_gradient2() to modify the color gradient used to visualize the start time of taxi trips. By default, ggplot would plot the following (default gradient color setting): # drop-off locations locations + geom_scattermore(aes(x=End_Lon, y=End_Lat, color = start_time ), pointsize = 1, alpha = 0.2) ggplot2 offers various functions to modify the color scales used in a plot. In the case of the example above, we visualize values of a continuous variable. Hence we use a gradient color scale. In case of categorical variables we need to modify the default discrete color scale. Recall the plot illustrating tipping behavior, where we highlight in which observations the client payd with credit card, cash, etc. # indicate natural numbers taxi[, dollar_paid := ifelse(Tip_Amt == round(Tip_Amt,0), &quot;Full&quot;, &quot;Fraction&quot;),] # extended x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(alpha=0.2, pointsize=3, aes(color=Payment_Type)) + facet_wrap(&quot;dollar_paid&quot;) Since we do not further specify the discrete color scheme to be used, ggplot simply uses its default color scheme for this plot. We can change this as follows. # indicate natural numbers taxi[, dollar_paid := ifelse(Tip_Amt == round(Tip_Amt,0), &quot;Full&quot;, &quot;Fraction&quot;),] # extended x/y plot taxiplot + geom_scattermore(alpha=0.2, pointsize = 3, aes(color=Payment_Type)) + facet_wrap(&quot;dollar_paid&quot;) + scale_color_discrete(type = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;)) 11.6 Wrapping up ggplot offers a unified approach to generate a variety of plots common in the big data context: heatmaps, GIS-like maps, density plots, 2D-bin plots, etc. Building on the concept of the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson et al. 2005), ggplot2 follows the paradigm of creating plots layer-by-layer, which offers a great flexibility regarding the visualization of complex (big) data. Standard plotting facilities in R (including in ggplot) are based on the concept of vector images (where each dot, line, area is defined as in a coordinate system). While vector images have the advantage of flexible scaling (no reliance on a specific resolution), when plotting many observations, the computational load to generate and store/hold such graphics in memory can be substantial. Plotting of large amounts of data can be made more efficient by relying on less complex shapes (e.g. for dots in a scatter-plot), or by directly rasterizing the plot into a bitmap-image (a raster-based image). In contrast to vector images, raster images are initiated with a specific resolution which defines the size of a matrix of pixels that constitutes the image. If plotting a scatter-plot based on many observations, this data structure is much more memory-efficient than defining each dot in a vector image. Specific types of plots such as hex-bin plots and other 2D-bin plots facilitate plotting large amounts of data independent of the type of image (vector or raster). Moreover, they can be useful to show/highlight specific patterns in large amounts of data that could not be seen in standard scatter plots.

The first part of our script to import and clean the data looks as follows. ########################################################### # Big Data Statistics: Flights data import and preparation # # U. Matter, January 2019 ########################################################### # SET UP ----------------- # fix variables DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/flights.csv&quot; # DATA IMPORT ---------------- flights &lt;- read.csv(DATA_PATH) # DATA PREPARATION -------- flights &lt;- flights[,-1:-3] When running this script, we notice that some of the steps need a certain amount of time to process. Moreover, while none of these steps obviously involves a lot of computation (such as a matrix inversion or numerical optimization), it quite likely involves memory allocation. We first read data into RAM (allocated to R by our operating system). It turns out that there are different ways to allocate RAM when reading data from a CSV file. Depending on the amount of data to be read in, one or the other approach might be faster. We first investigate the RAM allocation in R with mem_change() and mem_used(). # SET UP ----------------- # fix variables DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/flights.csv&quot; # load packages library(pryr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;pryr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## compose, partial ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## where ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:lobstr&#39;: ## ## ast, mem_used # check how much memory is used by R (overall) mem_used() ## 2.31 GB # check the change in memory due to each step # DATA IMPORT ---------------- mem_change(flights &lt;- read.csv(DATA_PATH)) ## 32.9 MB # DATA PREPARATION -------- flights &lt;- flights[,-1:-3] # check how much memory is used by R now mem_used() ## 2.34 GB The last result is kind of interesting. The object flights must have been larger right after importing it than at the end of the script. We have thrown out several variables, after all. Why does R still use that much memory? R does by default not ‘clean up’ memory unless it is really necessary (meaning no more memory is available). In this case, R has still way more memory available from the operating system, thus there is no need to ‘collect the garbage’ yet. However, we can force R to collect the garbage on the spot with gc(). This can be helpful to better keep track of the memory needed by an analytics script. gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used ## Ncells 8557389 457.1 15421401 823.6 12922540 ## Vcells 232739826 1775.7 411498500 3139.5 411463858 ## (Mb) ## Ncells 690.2 ## Vcells 3139.3 Now, let’s see how we can improve the performance of this script with regard to memory allocation. Most memory is allocated when importing the file. Obviously, any improvement of the script must still result in importing all the data. However, there are different ways to read data into RAM. read.csv() reads all lines of a csv file consecutively. In contrast, data.table::fread() first ‘maps’ the data file into memory and only then actually reads it in line by line. This involves an additional initial step, but the larger the file, the less relevant is this first step with regard to the total time needed to read all the data into memory.

Thus, we divide each value in the vector pce by a deflator 1.05. The first approach we take is based on a simple for-loop. In each iteration one element in pce is divided by the deflator and the resulting value is stored as a new element in the vector pce_real. # Naïve approach (ignorant of R) deflator &lt;- 1.05 # define deflator # iterate through each observation pce_real &lt;- c() n_obs &lt;- length(economics$pce) for (i in 1:n_obs) { pce_real &lt;- c(pce_real, economics$pce[i]/deflator) } # look at the result head(pce_real, 2) ## [1] 483.2 486.2 How long does it take? # Naïve approach (ignorant of R) deflator &lt;- 1.05 # define deflator # iterate through each observation pce_real &lt;- list() n_obs &lt;- length(economics$pce) time_elapsed &lt;- system.time( for (i in 1:n_obs) { pce_real &lt;- c(pce_real, economics$pce[i]/deflator) }) time_elapsed ## user system elapsed ## 0.093 0.000 0.095 Assuming a linear time algorithm (\\(O(n)\\)), we need that much time for one additional row of data: time_per_row &lt;- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs time_per_row ## elapsed ## 2.069e-05 If we deal with big data, say 100 million rows, that is # in seconds (time_per_row*100^4) ## elapsed ## 2069 # in minutes (time_per_row*100^4)/60 ## elapsed ## 34.48 # in hours (time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 ## elapsed ## 0.5747 Can we improve this? 12.2.3 Improvement 1: Pre-allocation of memory In the naïve approach taken above, each iteration of the loop causes R to re-allocate memory because the number of elements in vector pce_element is changing. In simple terms, this means that R needs to execute more steps in each iteration. We can improve this with a simple trick by initiating the vector in the right size to begin with (filled with NA values). # Improve memory allocation (still somewhat ignorant of R) deflator &lt;- 1.05 # define deflator n_obs &lt;- length(economics$pce) # allocate memory beforehand # Initiate the vector in the right size pce_real &lt;- rep(NA, n_obs) # iterate through each observation time_elapsed &lt;- system.time( for (i in 1:n_obs) { pce_real[i] &lt;- economics$pce[i]/deflator }) Let’s see if this helped to make the code faster. time_per_row &lt;- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs time_per_row ## elapsed ## 1.742e-06 Again, we can extrapolate (approximately) the computation time, assuming the data set had millions of rows. # in seconds (time_per_row*100^4) ## elapsed ## 174.2 # in minutes (time_per_row*100^4)/60 ## elapsed ## 2.904 # in hours (time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 ## elapsed ## 0.04839 This looks much better, but we can do even better. 12.2.4 Improvement 2: Exploit vectorization In this approach, we exploit the fact that in R ‘everything is a vector’ and that many of the basic R functions (such as math operators) are vectorized. In simple terms, this means that a vectorized operation is implemented in such a way that it can take advantage of the similarity of each of the vector’s elements. That is, R only has to figure out once how to apply a given function to a vector element in order to apply it to all elements of the vector. In a simple loop, R has to go through the same ‘preparatory’ steps again and again in each iteration, this is time-intensive. In this example, we specifically exploit that the division operator / is actually a vectorized function. Thus, the division by our deflator is applied to each element of economics$pce. # Do it &#39;the R way&#39; deflator &lt;- 1.05 # define deflator # Exploit R&#39;s vectorization! time_elapsed &lt;- system.time( pce_real &lt;- economics$pce/deflator ) # same result head(pce_real, 2) ## [1] 483.2 486.2 Now this is much faster. In fact, system.time() is not precise enough to capture the time elapsed… time_per_row &lt;- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs # in seconds (time_per_row*100^4) ## elapsed ## 0 # in minutes (time_per_row*100^4)/60 ## elapsed ## 0 # in hours (time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 ## elapsed ## 0 In order to measure the improvement, we use microbenchmark::microbenchmark() to measure the elapsed time in microseconds (millionth of a second). library(microbenchmark) # measure elapsed time in microseconds (avg.) time_elapsed &lt;- summary(microbenchmark(pce_real &lt;- economics$pce/deflator))$mean # per row (in sec) time_per_row &lt;- (time_elapsed/n_obs)/10^6 Now we get a more precise picture regarding the improvement due to vectorization (again, assuming 100 million rows): # in seconds (time_per_row*100^4) ## [1] 0.1524 # in minutes (time_per_row*100^4)/60 ## [1] 0.00254 # in hours (time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 ## [1] 4.234e-05 12.3 Case study: Bootstrapping and Parallel Processing In this example, we estimate a simple regression model that aims to assess racial discrimination in the context of police stops.54 The example is based on the ‘Minneapolis Police Department 2017 Stop Dataset’, containing data on nearly all stops made by the Minneapolis Police Department for the year 2017. We start with importing the data into R. url &lt;- &quot;https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/MplsStops.csv&quot; stopdata &lt;- data.table::fread(url) We specify a simple linear probability model that aims to test whether a person identified as ‘white’ is less likely to have her vehicle searched when stopped by the police. In order to take into account level-differences between different police precincts, we add precinct-indicators to the regression specification First, let’s remove observations with missing entries (NA) and code our main explanatory variable and the dependent variable. # remove incomplete obs stopdata &lt;- na.omit(stopdata) # code dependent var stopdata$vsearch &lt;- 0 stopdata$vsearch[stopdata$vehicleSearch==&quot;YES&quot;] &lt;- 1 # code explanatory var stopdata$white &lt;- 0 stopdata$white[stopdata$race==&quot;White&quot;] &lt;- 1 We specify our baseline model as follows. model &lt;- vsearch ~ white + factor(policePrecinct) And estimate the linear probability model via OLS (the lm function). fit &lt;- lm(model, stopdata) summary(fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = model, data = stopdata) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.1394 -0.0633 -0.0547 -0.0423 0.9773 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

If that is the case, we likely underestimate the coefficient’s standard errors. There is a standard approach to compute estimates for so-called cluster-robust standard errors which would take the problem of correlation over time within clusters into consideration (and deliver a more conservative estimate of the SEs). However, this approach only works well if the number of clusters in the data is roughly 50 or more. Here we only have 5. The alternative approach is to compute bootstrapped clustered standard errors. That is, we apply the bootstrap resampling procedure at the cluster level. Specifically, we draw \\(B\\) samples (with replacement), estimate and record for each bootstrap-sample the coefficient vector, and then estimate \\(SE_{boot}\\) based on the standard deviation of all respective estimated coefficient values. # load packages library(data.table) # set the &#39;seed&#39; for random numbers (makes the example reproducible) set.seed(2) # set number of bootstrap iterations B &lt;- 10 # get selection of precincts precincts &lt;- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct) # container for coefficients boot_coefs &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2) # draw bootstrap samples, estimate model for each sample for (i in 1:B) { # draw sample of precincts (cluster level) precincts_i &lt;- base::sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE) # get observations bs_i &lt;- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,]) bs_i &lt;- rbindlist(bs_i) # estimate model and record coefficients boot_coefs[i,] &lt;- coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients } Finally, let’s compute \\(SE_{boot}\\). se_boot &lt;- apply(boot_coefs, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd) se_boot ## [1] 0.004043 0.004690 Note that even with a very small \\(B\\), computing \\(SE_{boot}\\) takes up some time to compute. When setting \\(B\\) to over 500, computation time will be substantial. Also note that running this code does hardly use up more memory than the very simple approach without bootstrapping (after all, in each bootstrap iteration the data set used to estimate the model is approximately the same size as the original data set). There is little we can do to improve the script’s performance regarding memory. However we can tell R how to allocate CPU resources more efficiently to handle that many regression estimates. Particularly, we can make use of the fact that most modern computing environments (such as a laptop) have CPUs with several cores. We can exploit this fact by instructing the computer to run the computations in parallel (simultaneously computing on several cores). The following code is a parallel implementation of our bootstrap procedure which does exactly that. # install.packages(&quot;doSNOW&quot;, &quot;parallel&quot;) # load packages for parallel processing library(doSNOW) # get the number of cores available ncores &lt;- parallel::detectCores() # set cores for parallel processing ctemp &lt;- makeCluster(ncores) # registerDoSNOW(ctemp) # set number of bootstrap iterations B &lt;- 10 # get selection of precincts precincts &lt;- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct) # container for coefficients boot_coefs &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2) # bootstrapping in parallel boot_coefs &lt;- foreach(i = 1:B, .combine = rbind, .packages=&quot;data.table&quot;) %dopar% { # draw sample of precincts (cluster level) precincts_i &lt;- base::sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE) # get observations bs_i &lt;- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,]) bs_i &lt;- rbindlist(bs_i) # estimate model and record coefficients coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients } # be a good citizen and stop the snow clusters stopCluster(cl = ctemp) As a last step, we compute again \\(SE_{boot}\\). se_boot &lt;- apply(boot_coefs, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd) se_boot ## (Intercept) white ## 0.002707 0.004594 12.3.1 Parallelization with an EC2 instance Now, let’s go through the bootstrap example. First, let’s run the non-parallel implementation of the script. When executing the code below line-by-line, you will notice that essentially all parts of the script work exactly as on your local machine. This is one of the great advantages of running R/RStudio Server in the cloud. You can implement your entire data analysis locally (based on a small sample), test it locally, and then move it to the cloud and run it on a larger scale in exactly the same way (even with the same GUI). # CASE STUDY: PARALLEL --------------------------- # install packages install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;) install.packages(&quot;doSNOW&quot;) # load packages library(data.table) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ stopdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/MplsStops.csv&quot;) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # remove incomplete obs stopdata &lt;- na.omit(stopdata) # code dependent var stopdata$vsearch &lt;- 0 stopdata$vsearch[stopdata$vehicleSearch==&quot;YES&quot;] &lt;- 1 # code explanatory var stopdata$white &lt;- 0 stopdata$white[stopdata$race==&quot;White&quot;] &lt;- 1 ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ model &lt;- vsearch ~ white + factor(policePrecinct) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ fit &lt;- lm(model, stopdata) summary(fit) # bootstrapping: normal approach ## ----message=FALSE------------------------------------------------------- # set the &#39;seed&#39; for random numbers (makes the example reproducible) set.seed(2) # set number of bootstrap iterations B &lt;- 50 # get selection of precincts precincts &lt;- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct) # container for coefficients boot_coefs &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2) # draw bootstrap samples, estimate model for each sample for (i in 1:B) { # draw sample of precincts (cluster level) precincts_i &lt;- base::sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE) # get observations bs_i &lt;- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,]) bs_i &lt;- rbindlist(bs_i) # estimate model and record coefficients boot_coefs[i,] &lt;- coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients } ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ se_boot &lt;- apply(boot_coefs, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd) se_boot So far, we have only demonstrated that the simple implementation (non-parallel) works both locally and in the cloud. The real purpose of using an EC2 instance in this example is to make use of the fact that we can scale up our instance to have more CPU cores available for the parallel implementation of our bootstrap procedure. Recall that running the script below on our local machine will employ all cores available to an compute the bootstrap resampling in parallel on all these cores. Exactly the same thing happens when running the code below on our simple t2.micro instance. However this type of EC2 instance only has one core. You can check this when running the following line of code in RStudio Server (assuming the doSNOW package is installed and loaded): parallel::detectCores() When running the entire parallel implementation below, you will thus notice that it won’t compute the bootstrap SE any faster than with the non-parallel version above. However, by simply initiating another EC2 type with more cores, we can distribute the workload across many CPU cores, using exactly the same R-script. # bootstrapping: parallel approaach ## ----message=FALSE------------------------------------------------------- # install.packages(&quot;doSNOW&quot;, &quot;parallel&quot;) # load packages for parallel processing library(doSNOW) # get the number of cores available ncores &lt;- parallel::detectCores() # set cores for parallel processing ctemp &lt;- makeCluster(ncores) # registerDoSNOW(ctemp) # set number of bootstrap iterations B &lt;- 50 # get selection of precincts precincts &lt;- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct) # container for coefficients boot_coefs &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2) # bootstrapping in parallel boot_coefs &lt;- foreach(i = 1:B, .combine = rbind, .packages=&quot;data.table&quot;) %dopar% { # draw sample of precincts (cluster level) precincts_i &lt;- base::sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE) # get observations bs_i &lt;- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,]) bs_i &lt;- rbindlist(bs_i) # estimate model and record coefficients coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients } # be a good citizen and stop the snow clusters stopCluster(cl = ctemp) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------ se_boot &lt;- apply(boot_coefs, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd) se_boot 12.4 Case Study: Efficient Fixed Effects Estimation In this case study we look into a very common computational problem in applied econometrics: estimation of a fixed effects model with various fixed-effects units (i.e., many intercepts). We look at this in the context of the study on “Friends in High Places” by Cohen and Malloy (2014). Cohen and Malloy show that US Senators who are alumni of the same university/college tend to help each other out in votes on industrial policies if the corresponding policy is highly relevant for the state of one senator but not relevant for the state of the other senator. The data is provided along the published article and can be accessed here: http://doi.org/10.3886/E114873V1. The data (and code) is provided in STATA format. We can import the main data set with the foreign package. # SET UP ------------------ # load packages library(foreign) library(data.table) library(lmtest) # fix vars DATA_PATH &lt;- &quot;data/data_for_tables.dta&quot; # import data cm &lt;- as.data.table(read.dta(DATA_PATH)) # keep only clean obs cm &lt;- cm[!(is.na(yes)|is.na(pctsumyessameparty)|is.na(pctsumyessameschool)|is.na(pctsumyessamestate))] As part of this case study, we will replicate parts of Table 3 of the main article (p. 73). Specifically, we will estimate specifications (1) and (2). In both specifications, the dependent variable is an indicator yes that is equal to 1 if the corresponding senator voted Yes on the given bill and 0 otherwise. The main explanatory variables of interest are pctsumyessameschool (the percentage of senators from the same school as the corresponding senator who voted Yes on the given bill), pctsumyessamestate (the percentage of senators from the same state as the corresponding senator who voted Yes on the given bill), and pctsumyessameparty (the percentage of senators from the same party as the corresponding senator who voted Yes on the given bill) Specification 1 accounts for congress (time) fixed effects and senator (individual) fixed effects, and specification 2 account for congress-session-vote fixed effects and senator fixed effects. First, let us look at a very simple example to highlight where the computational burden in the estimation of such specifications is coming from. In terms of the regression model 1, the fixed effect specification means that we introduce an indicator variable (an intercept) for \\(N-1\\) senators and \\(M-1\\) congresses. That is, while the simple model matrix (\\(X\\)) without accounting for fixed effects has dimensions \\(425653\\times4\\). # pooled model (no FE) model0 &lt;- yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty dim(model.matrix(model0, data=cm)) ## [1] 425653 4 In contrast, the model matrix of specification (1) is of dimensions \\(425653\\times221\\), and the model matrix of specification (2) even of \\(425653\\times6929\\). model1 &lt;- yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty + factor(congress) + factor(id) -1 mm1 &lt;- model.matrix(model1, data=cm) dim(mm1) ## [1] 425653 168 Using OLS to estimate such a model thus involves the computation of a very large matrix inversion (because \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\intercal\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{y}\\)). In addition, the model matrix for specification 2 is about 22GB, which might further slow down the computer due to a lack of physical memory or even crash the R session altogether. In order to set a point of reference, we first estimate specification (1) with standard OLS. # fit specification (1) runtime &lt;- system.time(fit1 &lt;- lm(data = cm, formula = model1)) coeftest(fit1)[2:4,] ## Estimate Std. Error t value ## pctsumyessamestate 0.11861 0.001085 109.275 ## pctsumyessameparty 0.92640 0.001397 662.910 ## factor(congress)101 -0.01458 0.006429 -2.269 ## Pr(&gt;|t|) ## pctsumyessamestate 0.0000 ## pctsumyessameparty 0.0000 ## factor(congress)101 0.0233 # median amount of time needed for estimation runtime[3] ## elapsed ## 12.21 As expected, this takes quite some time to compute. However, there is an alternative approach to estimating such models that substantially reduces the computational burden by “sweeping out the fixed effects dummies”. In the simple case of only one fixed effect variable (e.g., only individual fixed effects), the trick is called “within transformation” or “demeaning” and is quite simple to implement. For each of the categories in the fixed effect variable the mean of the covariate and subtract the mean from the covariate’s value. # illustration of within transformation for the senator fixed effects cm_within &lt;- with(cm, data.table(yes = yes - ave(yes, id), pctsumyessameschool = pctsumyessameschool - ave(pctsumyessameschool, id), pctsumyessamestate = pctsumyessamestate - ave(pctsumyessamestate, id), pctsumyessameparty = pctsumyessameparty - ave(pctsumyessameparty, id) )) # comparison of dummy fixed effects estimator and within estimator dummy_time &lt;- system.time(fit_dummy &lt;- lm(yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty + factor(id) -1, data = cm )) within_time &lt;- system.time(fit_within &lt;- lm(yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty -1, data = cm_within)) # computation time comparison as.numeric(within_time[3])/as.numeric(dummy_time[3]) ## [1] 0.003915 # comparison of estimates coeftest(fit_dummy)[1:3,] ## Estimate Std.

However, Gaure (2013b) provides a generalization of the linear within-estimator to several fixed effects variables. This method is implemented in the lfe package (Gaure (2013a)). With this package, we can easily estimate both fixed-effect specifications (as well as the corresponding cluster-robust standard errors) in order to replicate the original results by Cohen and Malloy (2014). library(lfe) # model and clustered SE specifications model1 &lt;- yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty |congress+id|0|id model2 &lt;- yes ~ pctsumyessameschool + pctsumyessamestate + pctsumyessameparty |congress_session_votenumber+id|0|id # estimation fit1 &lt;- felm(model1, data=cm) fit2 &lt;- felm(model2, data=cm) Finally we can display the regression table. stargazer::stargazer(fit1,fit2, type=&quot;text&quot;, dep.var.labels = &quot;Vote (yes/no)&quot;, covariate.labels = c(&quot;School Connected Votes&quot;, &quot;State Votes&quot;, &quot;Party Votes&quot;), keep.stat = c(&quot;adj.rsq&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)) ## ## =================================================== ## Dependent variable: ## ---------------------------- ## Vote (yes/no) ## (1) (2) ## --------------------------------------------------- ## School Connected Votes 0.045*** 0.052*** ## (0.016) (0.016) ## ## State Votes 0.119*** 0.122*** ## (0.013) (0.012) ## ## Party Votes 0.926*** 0.945*** ## (0.022) (0.024) ## ## --------------------------------------------------- ## Observations 425,653 425,653 ## Adjusted R2 0.641 0.641 ## =================================================== ## Note: *p&lt;0.1; **p&lt;0.05; ***p&lt;0.01 References "],["gpus-and-machine-learning.html", "Chapter 13 GPUs and Machine Learning 13.1 Tensorflow/Keras example: predict housing prices 13.2 Data preparation 13.3 Model specification 13.4 Training and prediction", " Chapter 13 GPUs and Machine Learning A most common application of GPUs for scientific computing is machine learning, in particular deep learning (machine learning based on artificial neural networks). Training deep learning models can be very computationally intense and to an important part depends on tensor (matrix) multiplications. This is also an area where you might come across highly parallelized computing based on GPUs without even noticing it, as the now commonly used software to build and train deep neural nets (tensorflow, and the high-level Keras API) can easily be run on a CPU or GPU without any further configuration/preparation (apart from the initial installation of these programs). The example below is a simple illustration of how such techniques can be used in an econometrics context. –&gt; –&gt; 13.1 Tensorflow/Keras example: predict housing prices In this example we train a simple sequential model with two hidden layers in order to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (in USD 1,000) in the Boston area (data are from the 1970s). The original data and a detailed description can be found here. The example follows closely this keras tutorial published by RStudio. See RStudio’s keras installation guide for how to install keras (and tensorflow) and the corresponding R package keras.55 While the purpose of the example here is to demonstrate a typical (but very simple!) usage case of GPUs in machine learning, the same code should also run on a normal machine (without using GPUs) with a default installation of keras. Apart from keras, we load packages to prepare the data and visualize the output. Via dataset_boston_housing(), we load the dataset (shipped with the keras installation) in the format preferred by the keras library. # load packages library(keras) library(tibble) library(ggplot2) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;ggplot2&#39; ## The following object is masked _by_ &#39;.GlobalEnv&#39;: ## ## economics ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## expr library(tfdatasets) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;tfdatasets&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:SparkR&#39;: ## ## contains # load data boston_housing &lt;- dataset_boston_housing() ## Loaded Tensorflow version 2.5.0 str(boston_housing) ## List of 2 ## $ train:List of 2 ## ..$ x: num [1:404, 1:13] 1.2325 0.0218 4.8982 0.0396 3.6931 ... ## ..$ y: num [1:404(1d)] 15.2 42.3 50 21.1 17.7 18.5 11.3 15.6 15.6 14.4 ... ## $ test :List of 2 ## ..$ x: num [1:102, 1:13] 18.0846 0.1233 0.055 1.2735 0.0715 ... ## ..$ y: num [1:102(1d)] 7.2 18.8 19 27 22.2 24.5 31.2 22.9 20.5 23.2 ... 13.2 Data preparation In a first step, we split the data into a training set and a test set. The latter is used to monitor the out-of-sample performance of the model fit. Testing the validity of an estimated model by looking at how it performs out-of-sample is of particular relevance when working with (deep) neural networks, as they can easily lead to over-fitting. Validity checks based on the test sample are, therefore, often an integral part of modelling with tensorflow/keras. # assign training and test data/labels c(train_data, train_labels) %&lt;-% boston_housing$train c(test_data, test_labels) %&lt;-% boston_housing$test In order to better understand and interpret the dataset we add the original variable names, and convert it to a tibble. library(dplyr) column_names &lt;- c(&#39;CRIM&#39;, &#39;ZN&#39;, &#39;INDUS&#39;, &#39;CHAS&#39;, &#39;NOX&#39;, &#39;RM&#39;, &#39;AGE&#39;, &#39;DIS&#39;, &#39;RAD&#39;, &#39;TAX&#39;, &#39;PTRATIO&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;LSTAT&#39;) train_df &lt;- train_data %&gt;% as_tibble(.name_repair = &quot;minimal&quot;) %&gt;% setNames(column_names) %&gt;% mutate(label = train_labels) test_df &lt;- test_data %&gt;% as_tibble(.name_repair = &quot;minimal&quot;) %&gt;% setNames(column_names) %&gt;% mutate(label = test_labels) Next, we have a close look at the data. Note the usage of the term ‘label’ for what is usually called the ‘dependent variable’ in econometrics.56 As the aim of the exercise is to predict median prices of homes, the output of the model will be a continuous value (‘labels’). # check training data dimensions and content summary(train_data) ## V1 V2 V3 ## Min. : 0.01 Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0.46 ## 1st Qu.: 0.08 1st Qu.: 0.0 1st Qu.: 5.13 ## Median : 0.27 Median : 0.0 Median : 9.69 ## Mean : 3.75 Mean : 11.5 Mean :11.10 ## 3rd Qu.: 3.67 3rd Qu.: 12.5 3rd Qu.:18.10 ## Max. :88.98 Max. :100.0 Max. :27.74 ## V4 V5 V6 ## Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.385 Min. :3.56 ## 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.453 1st Qu.:5.88 ## Median :0.0000 Median :0.538 Median :6.20 ## Mean :0.0619 Mean :0.557 Mean :6.27 ## 3rd Qu.:0.0000 3rd Qu.:0.631 3rd Qu.:6.61 ## Max. :1.0000 Max. :0.871 Max. :8.72 ## V7 V8 V9 ## Min. : 2.9 Min. : 1.13 Min. : 1.00 ## 1st Qu.: 45.5 1st Qu.: 2.08 1st Qu.: 4.00 ## Median : 78.5 Median : 3.14 Median : 5.00 ## Mean : 69.0 Mean : 3.74 Mean : 9.44 ## 3rd Qu.: 94.1 3rd Qu.: 5.12 3rd Qu.:24.00 ## Max. :100.0 Max. :10.71 Max. :24.00 ## V10 V11 V12 ## Min. :188 Min. :12.6 Min. : 0.3 ## 1st Qu.:279 1st Qu.:17.2 1st Qu.:374.7 ## Median :330 Median :19.1 Median :391.2 ## Mean :406 Mean :18.5 Mean :354.8 ## 3rd Qu.:666 3rd Qu.:20.2 3rd Qu.:396.2 ## Max. :711 Max. :22.0 Max. :396.9 ## V13 ## Min. : 1.73 ## 1st Qu.: 6.89 ## Median :11.39 ## Mean :12.74 ## 3rd Qu.:17.09 ## Max. :37.97 head(train_data) # Display first 10 entries ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] 1.23247 0.0 8.14 0 0.538 6.142 91.7 3.977 ## [2,] 0.02177 82.5 2.03 0 0.415 7.610 15.7 6.270 ## [3,] 4.89822 0.0 18.10 0 0.631 4.970 100.0 1.333 ## [4,] 0.03961 0.0 5.19 0 0.515 6.037 34.5 5.985 ## [5,] 3.69311 0.0 18.10 0 0.713 6.376 88.4 2.567 ## [6,] 0.28392 0.0 7.38 0 0.493 5.708 74.3 4.721 ## [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] ## [1,] 4 307 21.0 396.9 18.72 ## [2,] 2 348 14.7 395.4 3.11 ## [3,] 24 666 20.2 375.5 3.26 ## [4,] 5 224 20.2 396.9 8.01 ## [5,] 24 666 20.2 391.4 14.65 ## [6,] 5 287 19.6 391.1 11.74 As the dataset contains variables ranging from per capita crime rate to indicators for highway access, the variables are obviously measured in different units and hence displayed on different scales.

We chose the RMSProp optimizer to find the minimum loss. # compile the model model %&gt;% compile( loss = &quot;mse&quot;, optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(), metrics = list(&quot;mean_absolute_error&quot;) ) Now we can get a summary of the model we are about to fit to the data. # get a summary of the model model 13.4 Training and prediction Given the relatively simple model and small dataset, we set the maximum number of epochs to 500 and allow for early stopping in case the validation loss (based on test data) is not improving for a while. # Set max. number of epochs epochs &lt;- 500 Finally, we fit the model while preserving the training history, and visualize the training progress. # Fit the model and store training stats history &lt;- model %&gt;% fit( x = train_df %&gt;% select(-label), y = train_df$label, epochs = epochs, validation_split = 0.2, verbose = 0 ) plot(history) 13.4.1 A word of caution From just comparing the number of threads of a modern CPU with the number of threads of a modern GPU, one might get the impression that parallel tasks should always be implemented for GPU computing. However, whether one approach or the other is faster can depend a lot on the overall task and the data at hand. Moreover, the parallel implementation of tasks can be done more or less well on either system. Really efficient parallel implementation of tasks can take a lot of coding time (particularly when done for GPUs).57.

Via its built-in ‘MLib’ library, Spark provides several high-level functions to conduct regression analyses. When calling these functions via sparklyr (or SparkR), their usage is actually very similar to the usual R packages/functions commonly used to run regressions in R. As a simple point of reference, we first estimate a linear model with the usual R approach (all computed in the R environment). First, we load the data as a common data.table. We could also convert a copy of the entire SparkDataFrame object to a data.frame or data.table and get essentially the same outcome. However, collecting the data from the RDD structure would take much longer than parsing the csv with fread. In addition, we only import the first 300 rows. Running regression analysis with relatively large datasets in Spark on a small local machine might fail or be rather slow.58 # flights_r &lt;- collect(flights) # very slow! flights_r &lt;- data.table::fread(&quot;data/flights.csv&quot;, nrows = 300) Now we run a simple linear regression (OLS) and show the summary output. # specify the linear model model1 &lt;- arr_delay ~ dep_delay + distance # fit the model with OLS fit1 &lt;- lm(model1, flights_r) # compute t-tests etc. summary(fit1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = model1, data = flights_r) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -42.39 -9.96 -1.91 9.87 48.02 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Again, working on a normal laptop this seems trivial, but the exact same command would allow us (when connected with Spark on a cluster computer in the cloud) to properly load and distribute the data.table on the cluster. Finally, we then fit the model with ml_linear_regression() and compute. # load data to spark flights_spark &lt;- copy_to(sc, flights_r, &quot;flights_spark&quot;) # fit the model fit1_spark &lt;- ml_linear_regression(flights_spark, formula = model1) # compute summary stats summary(fit1_spark) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -42.386 -9.965 -1.911 9.866 48.024 Coefficients: (Intercept) dep_delay distance -0.1826622687 0.9895529018 0.0001139616 R-Squared: 0.9172 Root Mean Squared Error: 15.42 Alternatively, we can use the spark_apply() function to run the regression analysis in R via the original R lm()-function.60 # fit the model spark_apply(flights_spark, function(df) broom::tidy(lm(arr_delay ~ dep_delay + distance, df)), names = c(&quot;term&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;std.error&quot;, &quot;statistic&quot;, &quot;p.value&quot;) ) # Source: spark&lt;?&gt; [?? x 5] term estimate std.error statistic p.value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 (Intercept) -0.183 1.68 -0.109 9.13e- 1 2 dep_delay 0.990 0.0173 57.3 1.63e-162 3 distance 0.000114 0.00124 0.0920 9.27e- 1 Finally, the parsnip package (together with the tidymodels package) provides a simple interface to run the same model (or similar specifications) on different “engines” (estimators/fitting algorithms), and several of the parsnip models are also supported in sparklyr. This significantly facilitates the transition from local testing (with a small subset of the data) to running the estimation on the entire data set on spark. library(tidymodels) library(parsnip) # simple local linear regression example from above # via tidymodels/parsnip fit1 &lt;- fit(linear_reg(engine=&quot;lm&quot;), model1, data=flights_r) tidy(fit1) # A tibble: 3 × 5 term estimate std.error statistic p.value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 (Intercept) -0.183 1.68 -0.109 9.13e- 1 2 dep_delay 0.990 0.0173 57.3 1.63e-162 3 distance 0.000114 0.00124 0.0920 9.27e- 1 # run the same on Spark fit1_spark &lt;- fit(linear_reg(engine=&quot;spark&quot;), model1, data=flights_spark) tidy(fit1_spark) # A tibble: 3 × 5 term estimate std.error statistic p.value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 (Intercept) -0.183 1.68 -0.109 9.13e- 1 2 dep_delay 0.990 0.0173 57.3 1.63e-162 3 distance 0.000114 0.00124 0.0920 9.27e- 1 We will further build on this interface in the next section where we look at different machine learning procedures for a classification problem. 14.2 Machine learning for classification Building on sparklyr, tidymodels, and parsnip, we test a set of machine learning models on the classification problem discussed in Varian (2014): predicting Titanic survivors. The data for this exercise can be downloaded from here: http://doi.org/10.3886/E113925V1. We import and prepare the data in R. # load into R, # select variables of interest, remove missing titanic_r &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/titanic3.csv&quot;) titanic_r &lt;- na.omit(titanic_r[, c(&quot;survived&quot;, &quot;pclass&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;)]) titanic_r$survived &lt;- ifelse(titanic_r$survived==1, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) In order to assess the performance of the classifiers later on, we split the sample into training and test data sets. We do so with the help of the rsample package, which provides a number of high-level functions to facilitate this kind of pre-processing. library(rsample) # split into training and test set titanic_r &lt;- initial_split(titanic_r) ti_training &lt;- training(titanic_r) ti_testing &lt;- testing(titanic_r) For the training and assessment of the classifiers, we transfer the two data sets to the spark cluster. # load data to spark ti_training_spark &lt;- copy_to(sc, ti_training, &quot;ti_training_spark&quot;) ti_testing_spark &lt;- copy_to(sc, ti_testing, &quot;ti_testing_spark&quot;) Now we can set up a ‘horse race’ between different ML approaches to find the best performing model. Overall, we will consider the following models/algorithms: Logistic regression Boosted trees Random forest # models to be used models &lt;- list(logit=logistic_reg(engine=&quot;spark&quot;, mode = &quot;classification&quot;), btree=boost_tree(engine = &quot;spark&quot;, mode = &quot;classification&quot;), rforest=rand_forest(engine = &quot;spark&quot;, mode = &quot;classification&quot;)) # train/fit the models fits &lt;- lapply(models, fit, formula=survived~., data=ti_training_spark) The fitted models (trained algorithms) can now be assessed with the help of the test data set. To this end, we use the high-level accuracy function provided in the yardstick package in order to compute the accuracy of the fitted models. We proceed in three steps. First, we use the fitted models to predict the outcomes (we classify cases into survived/not survived) of the test set. Then we fetch the predictions from the Spark cluster, format the variables, and add the actual outcomes as an additional column. # run predictions predictions &lt;- lapply(fits, predict, new_data=ti_testing_spark) # fetch predictions from Spark, format, add actual outcomes pred_outcomes &lt;- lapply(1:length(predictions), function(i){ x_r &lt;- collect(predictions[[i]]) # fetch from spark cluster (load into local R environment) x_r$pred_class &lt;- as.factor(x_r$pred_class) # format for predictions x_r$survived &lt;- as.factor(ti_testing$survived) # add true outcomes return(x_r) }) Finally, we compute the accuracy of the models, stack the results, and display them (ordered from best-performing to worst-performing.) acc &lt;- lapply(pred_outcomes, accuracy, truth=&quot;survived&quot;, estimate=&quot;pred_class&quot;) acc &lt;- bind_rows(acc) acc$model &lt;- names(fits) acc[order(acc$.estimate, decreasing = TRUE),] # A tibble: 3 × 4 .metric .estimator .estimate model &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 accuracy binary 0.817 rforest 2 accuracy binary 0.790 btree 3 accuracy binary 0.779 logit In this simple example, all models perform similarly well. However, none of them really performs outstandingly. In a next step, we might want to learn about which variables are considered more or less important for the predictions. Here, the tidy()-function is very useful. As long as the model types are comparable (here btree and rforest), tidy() delivers essentially the same type of summary for different models. tidy(fits[[&quot;btree&quot;]]) # A tibble: 5 × 2 feature importance &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 age 0.415 2 sex_male 0.223 3 pclass 0.143 4 sibsp 0.120 5 parch 0.0987 tidy(fits[[&quot;rforest&quot;]]) # A tibble: 5 × 2 feature importance &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 sex_male 0.604 2 pclass 0.188 3 age 0.120 4 sibsp 0.0595 5 parch 0.0290 Finally, we clean up and disconnect from the Spark cluster. spark_disconnect(sc) 14.3 Building machine learning pipelines with R and Spark Spark provides a framework to implement machine learning pipelines called ML Pipelines with the aim of facilitating the combination of various preparatory steps and ML algorithms into a pipeline/workflow. sparklyr provides a straightforward interface to ML Pipelines that allows implementing and testing the entire ML workflow in R and then easily deploying the final pipeline to a Spark cluster or more generally to the production environment. In the following example, we will revisit the e-commerce purchase prediction model (Google Analytics data from the Google Merchandise Shop) introduced in Chapter 1. That is, we want to prepare the Google Analytics data and then use a LASSO to find a set of important predictors for purchase decisions, all built into a ML pipeline. 14.3.1 Set up and data import All of the key ingredients are provided in sparklyr. However, I recommend using the ‘piping’ syntax provided in dplyr to implement the ML pipeline. In this context, using this syntax is particularly helpful to make the code easy to read and understand. # load packages library(sparklyr) library(dplyr) # fix vars INPUT_DATA &lt;- &quot;data/ga.csv&quot; Recall that the Google Analytics data set is small subset of the overall data generated by Google Analytics on a moderately sized e-commerce site. Hence, it makes perfectly sense to first implement and test the pipeline locally (on a local Spark installation), before deploying it on an actual Spark cluster in the cloud. In a first step, we thus copy the imported data to the local Spark instance. # import to local R session, prepare raw data ga &lt;- na.omit(read.csv(INPUT_DATA)) #ga$purchase &lt;- as.factor(ifelse(ga$purchase==1, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) # connect to, and copy the data to the local cluster sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = &quot;local&quot;) ga_spark &lt;- copy_to(sc, ga, &quot;ga_spark&quot;, overwrite = TRUE) 14.3.2 Building the pipeline The pipeline object is initiated via ml_pipeline(), in which we refer to the connection to the local Spark cluster. We then add the model specification (the formula) with ft_r_formula() to the pipeline. ft_r_formula essentially transforms the data in accordance with the common specification syntax in R (here: purchase ~ .). Among other things, this takes care of properly setting up the model matrix. Finally, we add the model via ml_logistic_regression(). We can set the penalization parameters via elastic_net_param (with alpha=1, we get the lasso). # ml pipeline ga_pipeline &lt;- ml_pipeline(sc) %&gt;% ft_string_indexer(input_col=&quot;city&quot;, output_col=&quot;city_output&quot;, handle_invalid = &quot;skip&quot;) %&gt;% ft_string_indexer(input_col=&quot;country&quot;, output_col=&quot;country_output&quot;, handle_invalid = &quot;skip&quot;) %&gt;% ft_string_indexer(input_col=&quot;source&quot;, output_col=&quot;source_output&quot;, handle_invalid = &quot;skip&quot;) %&gt;% ft_string_indexer(input_col=&quot;browser&quot;, output_col=&quot;browser_output&quot;, handle_invalid = &quot;skip&quot;) %&gt;% ft_r_formula(purchase ~ .) %&gt;% ml_logistic_regression(elastic_net_param = list(alpha=1)) Finally, we create a cross-validator object to train the model with a k-fold cross-validation and fit the model. For the sake of the example, we use only a 30-fold cross validation (to be run in parallel on 8 cores). # specify the hyperparameter grid # (parameter values to be considered in optimization) ga_params &lt;- list(logistic_regression=list(max_iter=80)) # create the cross-validator object set.seed(1) cv_lasso &lt;- ml_cross_validator(sc, estimator=ga_pipeline, estimator_param_maps = ga_params, ml_binary_classification_evaluator(sc), num_folds = 30, parallelism = 8) # train/fit the model cv_lasso_fit &lt;- ml_fit(cv_lasso, ga_spark) # note: this takes several minutes to run on a local machine (one node, 8 cores) Finally, we can inspect and further process the results, in particular the model’s performance. # pipeline summary cv_lasso_fit # average performance cv_lasso_fit$avg_metrics_df CrossValidatorModel (Transformer) &lt;cross_validator__38371a42_6189_4a7f_aa4b_fd6d1d763208&gt; (Parameters -- Tuning) estimator: Pipeline &lt;pipeline__a18eda42_7f0f_4051_8cfb_cfac32268d99&gt; evaluator: BinaryClassificationEvaluator &lt;binary_classification_evaluator__02d5b175_9c76_4a3c_9363_e4c708ed956c&gt; with metric areaUnderROC num_folds: 30 [Tuned over 1 hyperparameter set] (Best Model) PipelineModel (Transformer) with 6 stages &lt;pipeline__a18eda42_7f0f_4051_8cfb_cfac32268d99&gt; Stages |--1 StringIndexerModel (Transformer) | &lt;string_indexer__ebfe6c0f_7b1b_480c_8b9f_5dc22bf5484c&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | input_col: city | output_col: city_output | (Transformer Info) | labels: chr [1:561] &quot;Mountain View&quot; &quot;New York&quot; &quot;(not set)&quot; &quot;San Francisco&quot; &quot;Sunnyvale&quot; &quot;London&quot; &quot;San Jose&quot; &quot;Chicago&quot; &quot;Los Angeles&quot; &quot;Bangkok&quot; ... |--2 StringIndexerModel (Transformer) | &lt;string_indexer__71413b2a_bf9a_4225_bf8a_975662d1219d&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | input_col: country | output_col: country_output | (Transformer Info) | labels: chr [1:144] &quot;United States&quot; &quot;India&quot; &quot;Vietnam&quot; &quot;United Kingdom&quot; &quot;Thailand&quot; &quot;Canada&quot; &quot;Turkey&quot; &quot;Australia&quot; &quot;Taiwan&quot; &quot;Singapore&quot; &quot;Brazil&quot; ... |--3 StringIndexerModel (Transformer) | &lt;string_indexer__f2e2891f_86a2_4fc5_89fa_f06e2eb992f0&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | input_col: source | output_col: source_output | (Transformer Info) | labels: chr [1:69] &quot;(direct)&quot; &quot;google&quot; &quot;youtube.com&quot; &quot;analytics.google.com&quot; &quot;Partners&quot; &quot;dfa&quot; &quot;sites.google.com&quot; &quot;mail.google.com&quot; ... |--4 StringIndexerModel (Transformer) | &lt;string_indexer__94824e19_9b37_4c1c_a5e1_47f1c61633b9&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | input_col: browser | output_col: browser_output | (Transformer Info) | labels: chr [1:26] &quot;Chrome&quot; &quot;Safari&quot; &quot;Firefox&quot; &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; &quot;Android Webview&quot; &quot;Opera&quot; &quot;Safari (in-app)&quot; &quot;Opera Mini&quot; ... |--5 RFormulaModel (Transformer) | &lt;r_formula__558754cb_1f23_4df3_97dc_3eab74dd210b&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | features_col: features | label_col: label | (Transformer Info) | formula: chr &quot;purchase ~ .&quot; |--6 LogisticRegressionModel (Transformer) | &lt;logistic_regression__6a1f97d3_4630_4702_ada4_7608446683f0&gt; | (Parameters -- Column Names) | features_col: features | label_col: label | prediction_col: prediction | probability_col: probability | raw_prediction_col: rawPrediction | (Transformer Info) | coefficient_matrix: num [1, 1:809] 0 0.6 0.663 -2.425 -8.343 ... | coefficients: num [1:809] 0 0.6 0.663 -2.425 -8.343 ... | intercept: num -2.11 | intercept_vector: num -2.11 | num_classes: int 2 | num_features: int 809 | threshold: num 0.5 | thresholds: num [1:2] 0.5 0.5 areaUnderROC max_iter_1 1 0.8666304 80 Before closing the connection to the Spark cluster, we can save the entire pipeline to further work with it later on. # save the entire pipeline/fit ml_save( cv_lasso_fit, &quot;ga_cv_lasso_fit&quot;, overwrite = TRUE ) To reload the pipeline later on, run ml_load(sc, \"ga_cv_lasso_fit\"). 14.4 Wrapping up The key take-aways from this chapter are: When running econometric analysis such as linear or logistic regressions with massive amounts of data, sparklyr provides all basic functions you need. You can test your code on your local spark installation by connecting to the local ‘cluster’: spark_connect(master=\"local\"). This allows you to test your entire regression analysis script locally (on a sub-sample) before running the exact same script via a connection to a large spark cluster on AWS EMR. To do so, simply connect to the cluster via spark_connect(master = \"yarn\") from RStudio server, following the set up introduced in Section 8.4. The rsample-package provides easy-to-use high-level functions to split your dataset into training and test datasets: See ?initial_split, ?training, and ?testing The parsnip and broom packages provide a way to easily standardize regression output. This is very helpful if you want to verify your regression analysis implementation for Spark with the more familiar R regression frameworks such as lm(). For example, compare the standard R OLS output with the linear regression output computed on a Spark cluster: fit(linear_reg(engine=\"lm\"), model1, data=flights_r) for R’s standard OLS, fit(linear_reg(engine=\"spark\"), model1, data=flights_r) for Spark. For more advanced users, sparklyr provides a straightforward way to efficiently implement entire Spark machine learning pipelines in an R script via ml_pipeline(sc) and the dplyr-style pipe operators %&gt;%, including model specification, data preparation, and selection ans specification of the estimator.

In this chapter we explore these functions and the corresponding workflows to do text analysis on an AWS EMR cluster running Spark. Thereby we focus on the first few key components of a modern NLP pipeline. The figure below provides an overview over the main components of such a pipeline. Up until the deployment of an NLP-model, all of the steps involved constitute the typical workflow of economic research projects based on text data. Conveniently, all of these first crucial steps of analyzing text data are covered in a few high-level functions provided in the sparklyr package. Implementing these steps and running them based on massive amounts of text data on an AWS EMR cluster is thus straightforward. To get familiar with the basic syntax, the following subsection covers the first steps in such a pipeline based on a very simple text example. 15.1 Getting started: import, pre-processing, and word count The following example briefly guides through some of the most common first steps when processing text data for NLP. In the code example, we process Friedrich Schiller’s “Wilhelm Tell” (English edition; Project Gutenberg Book ID 2782), which we download from Project Gutenberg. The example can easily be extended to process many more books. The example is set up to work straightforwardly on an AWS EMR cluster. However, given the relatively small amount of data processed here, you can also run it locally. In case you want to run it on EMR, simply follow the steps Chapter 6.4 to set up the cluster and log in to RStudio on the master node. The sparklyr package is already installed on EMR (if you use the bootstrap-script introduced in Chapter 6.4 for the set up of the cluster), but other packages might still have to be installed. We first load the packages and connect the RStudio session to the cluster (in case you run this locally, use spark_connect(master=\"local\")). # install additional packages # install.packages(&quot;gutenbergr&quot;) # to download book texts from Project Gutenberg # install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) # for the data preparatory steps # load packages library(sparklyr) library(gutenbergr) library(dplyr) # fix vars TELL &lt;- &quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6788/pg6788.txt&quot; # connect rstudio session to cluster sc &lt;- spark_connect(master = &quot;yarn&quot;) We fetch the raw text of the book and copy it to the Spark cluster. Note that you can do this sequentially for many books without exhausting the master node’s RAM and then further process the data on the cluster. # Data gathering and preparation # fetch Schiller&#39;s Tell, load to cluster tmp_file &lt;- tempfile() download.file(TELL, tmp_file) raw_text &lt;- readLines(tmp_file) tell &lt;- data.frame(raw_text=raw_text) tell_spark &lt;- copy_to(sc, tell, &quot;tell_spark&quot;, overwrite = TRUE) The text data will be processed in a Spark DataFrame columnd behind the tbl_spakr-object. First, we remove empty lines of text, select the column containing all the text, and then remove all non-numeric and non-alphabetical characters. The latter step is an important text cleaning step as we want to avoid special characters to be considered words or part of words later on. # data cleaning tell_spark &lt;- filter(tell_spark, raw_text!=&quot;&quot;) tell_spark &lt;- select(tell_spark, raw_text) tell_spark &lt;- mutate(tell_spark, raw_text = regexp_replace(raw_text, &quot;[^0-9a-zA-Z]+&quot;, &quot; &quot;)) Now we can split the lines of text in column raw_text into individual words (sequences of characters that have been separated by white space). To this end we can call a Spark feature transformation routine called the tokenization, which essentially breaks text into individual terms. Specifically, each line of raw text in column raw_text will be split into words. The overall result (stored in a new column specified with output_col), is then a nested list in which each word is an element of the corresponding line element. # split into words tell_spark &lt;- ft_tokenizer(tell_spark, input_col = &quot;raw_text&quot;, output_col = &quot;words&quot;) Now we can call another feature transformer called “stop words remover”, which excludes all the stop words (words often occurring in a text but not carrying much information) from the nested word list. # remove stop-words tell_spark &lt;- ft_stop_words_remover(tell_spark, input_col = &quot;words&quot;, output_col = &quot;words_wo_stop&quot;) Finally, we combine all of the words in one vector and store the result in a new Spark DataFrame called “all_tell_words” (by calling compute()) and add some final cleaning steps. # unnest words, combine in one row all_tell_words &lt;- mutate(tell_spark, word = explode(words_wo_stop)) # final cleaning all_tell_words &lt;- select(all_tell_words, word) all_tell_words &lt;- filter(all_tell_words, 2&lt;nchar(word)) Based on this cleaned set of words, we can compute the word count for the entire book. # word count and store result in Spark memory compute(count(all_tell_words, word), &quot;wordcount_tell&quot;) ## # Source: spark&lt;wordcount_tell&gt; [?? x 2] ## word n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 language 2 ## 2 martin 1 ## 3 baron 8 ## 4 nephew 3 ## 5 hofe 3 ## 6 reding 16 ## 7 fisherman 39 ## 8 baumgarten 32 ## 9 hildegard 3 ## 10 soldiers 4 ## # … with more rows "],["appendix-a.html", "A Appendix A A.1 GitHub", " A Appendix A A.1 GitHub A.1.1 Initiate a new repository Log in to your GitHub account and click on the plus-sign in the upper right corner.

Some operators or functions in R only accept data of a specific type as arguments. For example, we can store the numeric values 1.5 and 3 in the variables a and b, respectively. a &lt;- 1.5 b &lt;- 3 a + b ## [1] 4.5 R interprets this data as type double (class ‘numeric’): typeof(a) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; object.size(a) ## 56 bytes If, however, we define a and b as follows, R will interpret the values stored in a and b as text (character). a &lt;- &quot;1.5&quot; b &lt;- &quot;3&quot; a + b typeof(a) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; object.size(a) ## 56 bytes Note that the symbols 1.5 take up more or less memory depending on the data-type they are stored in. This directly links to how data/information is stored/represented in binary code, which in turn is reflected in how much memory is used to store these symbols in an object as well as what we can do with it. B.1.1 Example in R: Data types and information storage Given the fact that computers only understand 0s and 1s, different approaches are taken to map these digital values to other symbols or images (text, decimal numbers, pictures, etc.) that we humans can more easily make sense of. Regarding text and numbers, these mappings involve character encodings (in which combinations of 0s and 1s represent a character in a specific alphabet) and data types. Let’s illustrate the main concepts with the simple numerical example from above. When we see the decimal number 139 written somewhere, we know that it means ‘one-hundred-and-thirty-nine’. The fact that our computer is able to print 139 on the screen means that our computer can somehow map a sequence of 0s and 1s to the symbols 1, 3, and 9. Depending on what we want to do with the data value 139 on our computer, there are different ways of how the computer can represent this value internally. Inter alia, we could load it into RAM as a string (‘text’/‘character’) or as an integer (‘natural number’) or double (numeric, floating point number). All of them can be printed on screen but only the latter two can be used for arithmetic computations. This concept can easily be illustrated in R. We initiate a new variable with the value 139. By using this syntax, R by default initiates the variable as an object of type double. We then can use this variable in arithmetic operations. my_number &lt;- 139 # check the class typeof(my_number) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; # arithmetic my_number*2 ## [1] 278 When we change the data type to ‘character’ (string) such operations are not possible. # change and check type/class my_number_string &lt;- as.character(my_number) typeof(my_number_string) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # try to multiply my_number_string*2 ## Error in my_number_string * 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator If we change the variable to type integer, we can still use math operators. # change and check type/class my_number_int &lt;- as.integer(my_number) typeof(my_number_int) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; # arithmetics my_number_int*2 ## [1] 278 Having all variables in the right type is relevant for data analytics with all kind of sample sizes. However, given the fact that different data types have to be represented differently internally, different types might take up more or less memory and therefore substantially affect the performance when dealing with massive amounts of data. We can illustrate this point with object.size(): object.size(&quot;139&quot;) ## 112 bytes object.size(139) ## 56 bytes B.2 Data structures For now, we have only looked at individual bytes of data. An entire data set can consist of gigabytes of data and contain both text and numeric values. R provides several classes of objects providing different data structures. Both the choice of data types and data structures to store data in can affect how much memory is needed to contain a dataset in RAM. B.2.1 Vectors vs Factors in R Vectors are collections of values of the same type. They can contain either all numeric values or all character values. For example, we can initiate a character vector containing information on the home towns of persons participating in a survey. hometown &lt;- c(&quot;St.Gallen&quot;, &quot;Basel&quot;, &quot;St.Gallen&quot;) hometown ## [1] &quot;St.Gallen&quot; &quot;Basel&quot; &quot;St.Gallen&quot; object.size(hometown) ## 200 bytes Unlike in the data types example above, it would likely be not that practical to store these values as type numeric to save memory. R would not know how to translate these strings into floating point numbers. Alternatively, we could think of a correspondence table that assigns a numeric (id) code to each unique town name in the data set. This way we would save memory but it would mean additional effort to work with the data. Fortunately, basic R already implements exactly this idea in a user-friendly way in a data-structure called factor. Factors are sets of categories. Thus, the values come from a fixed set of possible values. Considering the same example as above, we can store the same information in an object of type class factor. hometown_f &lt;- factor(c(&quot;St.Gallen&quot;, &quot;Basel&quot;, &quot;St.Gallen&quot;)) hometown_f ## [1] St.Gallen Basel St.Gallen ## Levels: Basel St.Gallen object.size(hometown_f) ## 584 bytes At first sight, the fact that hometown_f takes up more memory than its character vector sibling seems odd. But, we have encountered this kind of ‘paradox’ before. Again, the more sophisticated approach involves an ‘overhead’ (here not in terms of computing time but in terms of structure encoded in an object). hometown_f has more ‘structure’ (i.e., a mapping of numbers to ‘factor levels’/category labels). This additional structure is also information that needs to be stored somewhere. As in previous examples of this ‘overhead costs’, this disadvantage is diminishing with larger data sets: # create a large character vector hometown_large &lt;- rep(hometown, times = 1000) # and the same content as factor hometown_large_f &lt;- factor(hometown_large) # compare size object.size(hometown_large) ## 24168 bytes object.size(hometown_large_f) ## 12568 bytes B.2.2 Matrices/Arrays Matrices are two-dimensional collections of values, arrays higher-dimensional collections of values, of the same type. For example, we can initiate a three-row/two-column numeric matrix as follows. my_matrix &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3) my_matrix ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 And a three-dimensional numeric array as follows. my_array &lt;- array(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), dim = 3) my_array ## [1] 1 2 3 B.2.3 Data frames, tibbles, and data tables Recall that data frames are the typical representation of a (table-like) data set in R. Each column can contain a vector of a given data type (or a factor), but all columns need to be of identical length. Thus in the context of data analysis, we would say that each row of a data frame contains an observation, and each column contains a characteristic of this observation. The historical implementation of data frames in R is not very comfortable to work with large data sets.61 Several newer implementations of the data-frame concept in R aim to make data processing faster. One is called tibbles, implemented and used in the tidyverse packages. The other is called data table, implemented in the data.table-package. In this course we will focus on the data.table-package. Here is how we define a data.table in R: # load package library(data.table) # initiate a data.table dt &lt;- data.table(person = c(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;), age = c(50, 30), gender = c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;)) dt ## person age gender ## 1: Alice 50 f ## 2: Ben 30 m B.2.4 Lists Similar to data frames and data tables, lists can contain different types of data in each element. For example, a list could contain different other lists, data frames, and vectors with differing numbers of elements. This flexibility can easily be demonstrated by combining some of the data structures created in the examples above: my_list &lt;- list(my_array, my_matrix, dt) my_list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 ## ## [[3]] ## person age gender ## 1: Alice 50 f ## 2: Ben 30 m B.3 R-tools to investigate structures and types package function purpose utils str() Compactly display the structure of an arbitrary R object. base class() Prints the class(es) of an R object. base typeof() Determines the (R-internal) type or storage mode of an object. In the early days of R this was not really an issue because data sets that are rather large by today’s standards (in the Gigabytes) could not have been handled properly by normal computers anyhow (due to a lack of RAM).↩︎ "],["appendix-c.html", "C Appendix C C.1 Install Hadoop (on Ubuntu Linux) C.2 Manually set up a database server in the cloud", " C Appendix C C.1 Install Hadoop (on Ubuntu Linux) # download binary wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.10.1/hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz # download checksum wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.10.1/hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz.sha512 # run the verification shasum -a 512 hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz # compare with value in mds file cat hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz.sha512 # if all is fine, unpack tar -xzvf hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz # move to proper place sudo mv hadoop-2.10.1 /usr/local/hadoop # then point to this version from hadoop # open the file /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh # in a text editor and add (where export JAVA_HOME=...) export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed &quot;s:bin/java::&quot;) # clean up rm hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz rm hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz.sha512 After running all of the steps above, run the following line in the terminal to check the installation # check installation /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop C.2 Manually set up a database server in the cloud Working with an SQL database in the cloud via AWS RDS is probably sufficient for most simple use cases. However, for some projects you might want to have more flexibility regarding settings and configurations. A practical solution to this is to set up “manually” a SQL-server on an EC2 instance (and then work with it via RStudio-Server). The following example, based on Walkowiak (2016), guides you through the first step to set up such a database in the cloud. For most of the installation steps you are referred to the respective pages in Walkowiak (2016) (Chapter 5: ’MariaDB with R on a Amazon EC2 instance, pages 255ff). However, since some of the steps shown in the book are outdated, the example below hints to some alternative/additional steps needed to make the database run on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine. After launching the EC2 instance on AWS, use the following terminal commands to install R: # update ubuntu packages sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install r-base and to install RStudio Server (on Ubuntu 18.04, as of April 2020): sudo apt-get install gdebi-core wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.5033-amd64.deb sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.5033-amd64.deb Following Walkowiak (2016) (pages 257f), we first set up a new user and give it permissions to ssh directly to the EC2 instance (this way we can then more easily upload data ‘for this user’). # create user sudo adduser umatter When prompted for additional information just hit enter (for default). Now we can grant the user the permissions sudo cp -r /home/ubuntu/.ssh /home/umatter/ cd /home/umatter/ sudo chown -R umatter:umatter .ssh Then install MariaDB as follows. sudo apt update sudo apt install mariadb-server sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev sudo apt install libxml2-dev # needed later (dependency for some R packages) If prompted to set a password for the root database user (user with all database priviledges), type in and confirm the chosen password.62 C.2.0.1 Data import With the permissions set above, we can send data from the local machine directly to the instance via ssh. We use this to first transfer the raw data to the instance and then import it to the database. The aim is to import the same simple data set economics.csv used in the local SQLite examples of Lecture 7. Following the instructions of Walkowiak (2016), pages 252 to 254, we upload the economics.csv file (instead of the example data used in Walkowiak (2016)). Note that in all the code examples below, the username is umatter, and the IP-address will have to be replaced with the public IP-address of your EC2 instance. Open a new terminal window and send the economics.csv data as follows to the instance. # from the directory where the key-file is stored... scp -r -i &quot;mariadb_ec2.pem&quot; ~/Desktop/economics.csv umatter@ec2-184-72-202-166.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/ Then switch back to the terminal connected to the instance and start the MariaDB server. # start the MariaDB server sudo service mysql start # log into the MariaDB client as root sudo mysql -uroot If not prompted to do so when installing MariaDB (see above), add a new root user in order to login to MariaDB without the sudo (here we simply set the password to ‘Password1’). GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to &#39;root&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;Password1&#39;; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Restart the mysql server and log in with the database root user. # start the MariaDB server sudo service mysql restart # log into the MariaDB client as root mysql -uroot -p Now we can initiate a new database called data1. CREATE database data1; To work with the newly created database, we have to ‘select’ it. USE data1; Then, we create the first table of our database and import data into it. Note that we only have to slightly adjust the former SQLite syntax to make this work (remove double quotes for field names). In addition, note that we can use the same field types as in the SQLite DB.63 -- Create the new table CREATE TABLE econ( date DATE, pce REAL, pop INTEGER, psavert REAL, uempmed REAL, unemploy INTEGER ); After following the steps in Walkowiak (2016), pages 259-262, we can import the economics.csv-file to the econ table in MariaDB (again, assuming the username is umatter). Note that the syntax to import data to a table is quite different from the SQLite example in Lecture 7. LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE &#39;/home/umatter/economics.csv&#39; INTO TABLE econ FIELDS TERMINATED BY &#39;,&#39; LINES TERMINATED BY &#39;\\n&#39; IGNORE 1 ROWS; Now we can start using the newly created database from within RStudio Server running on our EC2 instance (following Walkowiak (2016), pages 263ff). As in the SQLite examples in Lecture 7, we can now query the database from within the R console (this time using RMySQL instead of RSQLite, and using R from within RStudio Server in the cloud!). First, we need to connect to the newly created MariaDB database. # install package #install.packages(&quot;RMySQL&quot;) # load packages library(RMySQL) # connect to the db con &lt;- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), user = &quot;root&quot;, password = &quot;Password1&quot;, host = &quot;localhost&quot;, dbname = &quot;data1&quot;) In our first query, we select all (*) variable values of the observation of January 1968. # define the query query1 &lt;- &quot; SELECT * FROM econ WHERE date = &#39;1968-01-01&#39;; &quot; # send the query to the db and get the result jan &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, query1) jan # date pce pop psavert uempmed unemploy # 1 1968-01-01 531.5 199808 11.7 5.1 2878 Now let’s select all year/months in which there were more than 15 million unemployed, ordered by date. query2 &lt;- &quot; SELECT date FROM econ WHERE unemploy &gt; 15000 ORDER BY date; &quot; # send the query to the db and get the result unemp &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, query2) head(unemp) # date # 1 2009-09-01 # 2 2009-10-01 # 3 2009-11-01 # 4 2009-12-01 # 5 2010-01-01 # 6 2010-02-01 When done working with the database, we close the connection to the MariaDB database with dbDisconnect(con).
